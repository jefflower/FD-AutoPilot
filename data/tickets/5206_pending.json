Simsonn 6+R H Gear Shifter – Precision Engineering for Ultimate Sim Racing Control – SIMSONN<https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-racing-simulator-hexagonal-shifter>\r\nIf not, I would love it if you made a shifter that can act both as H and sequential, kinda like Fanatec SQ v1.5 and Simagic DS-8X.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTrygve\r\n\r\n",

I hope you will try to keep the feel and function of the 6+R H shifter, as judging by reviews it hits a nice balance between feel, force and noise levels. Just what I'm looking for really, except the missing sequential function obviously.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTrygve\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",
