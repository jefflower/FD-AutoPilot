We have urgently arranged air freight and expect shipment on the 22nd, with an estimated delivery date around the 25th.  2. The power supply was delayed for two weeks due to a product upgrade. The upgrade is now complete, and we shipped it on the 14th.  You can track your shipping information via the following link:  https://t.17track.net/en#nums=SF6047238969245  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

So are\r\nyou upgrading my order to the pro x due to the shipping delay?   If so I'm\r\nokay with that.  However your website said nothing about product not being\r\nin stock.  Secondly I don't completely understand the power supply upgrade\r\nsituation fully or why the power supply would be shipped separately from\r\nthe rest of the order.  Can you please further clarify this information for\r\nme please? Thank you for your response.\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Jan 17, 2026, 3:28 AM service@simsonn.com ",

The pedal is in one package, and the power supply is in the other.  At present, the pedal hasn't been shipped yet because it's out of stock. We have urgently arranged for air freight. It is expected to be shipped on the 22nd and delivered around the 25th.  The power supply was shipped on the 14th.  Do you understand what I'm saying? If you have any questions, you can contact me in time.",
