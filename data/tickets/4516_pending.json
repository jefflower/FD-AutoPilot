It doesn’t happen often but I’ve had\r\nmultiple race ending incidents because of it. It only started when I began\r\nusing the Simsonn Manager Software instead of a 3rd party such as Freejoy.\r\nI’ll be on the brake at my braking point but it’ll still say i’m on the gas\r\nuntil my pedal inputs catch up around a second later. Is there anything I\r\ncan do about this?\r\n\r\n",
