Please download the VKB JoyTester tool from Google to check whether the Rx axis is interfering with the pedals, and send me a video of the pedal test.  In addition, please use SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1, click Restore on the interface, then click Save, and replug the USB cable to see if the issue is resolved. If the problem persists, you can try Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-proxultra.sfu. This will disable the 4th axis, which may be causing the interference.

Since the RX axis has not yet been disabled in the software, you may see the RX axis jittering. Once you disable the RX axis, it will no longer affect device binding in iRacing or other games. ",
