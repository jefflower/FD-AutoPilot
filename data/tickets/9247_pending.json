  "description_text": "I ordered the Pro X Ultra Pedals w/ Haptics, but never received the haptics. Order #SSN4937. The pedals have arrived on December 24th. I had a tracking number with the pedals (FedEx #887171803971). I’m not sure if the haptics were sent separately and had a different tracking number. The only item in the box was the pedals. If there is not another tracking number then I guess the haptics were never sent. What can I do about this?\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
