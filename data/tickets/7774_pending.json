  "description_text": "Hi. I purchased the following items through your website (my email address is   sp-czesci@o2.pl , address is Andrzej Pańczyk, 62-700 Turek, ul. Zdrojki Prawne 55, Poland): a Simsonn HS Pro gear shift lever and a Simsonn HB Pro Racing handbrake. Unfortunately, after making the payment on December 2, 2025 (payment confirmation via App Pay attached), I did not receive any confirmation email or shipping confirmation. I am afraid I have been scammed. Could you please verify whether you received my transfer? If so, please send me the tracking number. When I log in to your website, I do not see that I have placed any order with you, and the money has already been transferred. Please verify this. Thank you in advance and best regards, Andrzej Pańczyk\r\r\n\r\n",
