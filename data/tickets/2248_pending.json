  "description_text": "When I start up my computer the VAM Pros are connected to simhub, I launch\r\ninto iRacing and they are working as expected, and after a few minutes they\r\nare no longer connected to Simhub. Restarting the software does not seem to\r\nhelp, only restarting the entire computer. However, after a few minutes,\r\nthey disconnected again.\r\nThis is a new issue, when I first got the pedals and VAM Pro they worked\r\nperfectly fine, including sessions lasting multiple hours, this issue just\r\nstarted in the last few days after the newest update to the Simsonn\r\nsoftware and firmware update.\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Andrew K,  If you are using a Fanatec base, the issue may be related to EMI (electromagnetic interference). In addition, please make sure to use the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC instead of a USB hub to ensure stable power supply. Also, avoid running SIMHUB and SIMSONN Manager software at the same time. Here are the recommended steps to address interference issues:      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LciAFDFWJ1w  ",
