  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Support,\r\n\r\ni ordered the SIMSONN Plus X \"BLACK-P2-H2-Plate\" which means Brake and\r\nThrottle with baseplate on the 02.12 via Amazon.\r\n\r\nA package arrived today, but I noticed that it only contained the two\r\npedals, without the baseplate and heelplate.\r\n\r\nMy Amazon order number is 306-1184090-0857104.\r\nThe order is shown as completed on the Amazon website.\r\n\r\nThe tracking number I received from Amazon also only shows one package,\r\nwhich arrived today as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nHas something gone wrong here? Will I still receive the baseplate?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDavid Mioska\r\n\r\n",
