  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nSo after quite a long wait I got the VAM Pros (+ new Control Box) to pair\r\nwith my Plus Pedals.\r\nInstalled everything and calibrated.\r\n\r\nI use Simhub to get the Telemetry to connect iRacing to the Vam Pro's\r\nHowever as soon as I am ingame (iRacing) and hit the throttle for example\r\nand the vam pro's start rattling, the throttle gets cut off. Same when\r\nhitting and the brakes with ABS. When turning off the vam pros in simhub,\r\nthe throttle and brakes work fine (however obviously the VAM Pros don't).\r\n\r\nI did not manage to use Simsonn Simmanager Pro to work with iRacing...\r\n\r\nPlease help me :)\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\n",
