      "body_text": "Hi Loox,  I noticed your comment mentioning that our red elastomer feels too stiff. In fact, we designed three different hardness levels, while Heusinkveld only offers two. You can try removing the 10 mm spacer inside the black brake spring, which will make the pedal feel softer — the default factory setup is tuned for an F1-style short brake travel. Please also note that the Heusinkveld damper has an 8 mm inner diameter, while ours is 10 mm, so they are not directly interchangeable. ",
