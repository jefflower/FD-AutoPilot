The throttle signal flickers/jumps erratically in DIView, Windows, and iRacing — even when the throttle pedal cable is completely unplugged.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> What I’ve tested:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Different USB ports\r\n> Swapped cables between the brake and throttle\r\n> Confirmed brake works fine\r\n> Tried calibration and firmware software\r\n> Throttle input flickers in DIView even with no cable connected\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> There’s no visible serial number on the unit, and it doesn’t show in the Simsonn software. \r\n> \r\n> Order number: SSN1791\r\n> \r\n> Date of purchase: 06-18-2025 (june 18th)\r\n> \r\n> Purchased through simsonn website.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Attached is a video of what the USB controller is showing, both with and without pedals plugged in.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Thanks,\r\n> \r\n> Michael Aliffi\r\n> \r\n\r\n",
