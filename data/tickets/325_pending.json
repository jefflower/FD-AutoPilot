  "description_text": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI recently purchased your Simsonn Upgraded Pro Plus Pedals on Amazon and I’m having issues with my tracking number. My amazon order number is 112-7254322-1529816. The tracking number you all sent to Amazon is incorrect, I contacted UPS and the name and delivery address attached to the tracking number is not my name or address. I tried calling the number on your website and the number is not active. If someone could help me with this issue that would be great. My name is Tyler Hesseling and order was placed on June 2nd through Amazon. Please let me know if you need any more information. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nTyler Hesseling\r\n864-380-8757\r\ntylerhesseling@gmail.com\r\n",
