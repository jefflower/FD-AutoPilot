  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\nI hope you are doing well.\r\nI’m writing to kindly follow up regarding my commission payment. The total commission amount is $281.95, and I have received $206.15 so far. There is a remaining balance of $75.80 that has not yet been paid.\r\nThis balance has now been outstanding for nearly three months. I completely understand that delays can occasionally happen, and I would really appreciate it if you could share an update on the payment status and the expected timeline for completion.\r\nReceiving this payment would help me continue my work smoothly and maintain the resources needed to keep creating value and driving sales for your company.\r\nThank you very much for your time and understanding. I look forward to your reply.\r\nKind regards,\r\nDavid Long\r\n\r\n\r\n",
