As for the clicking sound you mentioned, please try removing the hydraulic rod to check if the sound persists:    If the sound is still present, please send me a video so I can help further diagnose the issue;    If the hydraulic rod is confirmed to be faulty, we will provide a new replacement free of charge.",
