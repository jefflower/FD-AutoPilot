  "description_text": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have purchased the haptic motors VAM pro for all 3 pedals and I noticed\r\nthat the bracket is different for 1 of the pedals so the motors are\r\npositioned 2 horizontally and 1 vertically, is that correct? I also noticed\r\nthat now they are plugged to a power supply. The led light is always on and\r\ncannot be turned off unless unplugged which is very inconvenient, any way\r\naround this?\r\n\r\nLastly I've tried for 10 minutes or so and maybe they were set a bit too\r\nhigh and vibrate too much but nearly all the screws came undone, is\r\nthat normal?\r\n\r\n",
