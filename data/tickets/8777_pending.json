  "description_text": "Hey,\n\nI am following up regarding my return for order #SSN3936.\n\nAs per your email, you have confirmed receipt of the package and stated that you would process the refund once the inspection is complete. The items were shipped on December 6th via Bpost (tracking: CE636792546BE and CE636792648BE), and both packages have been delivered to your warehouse in Neumünster.\n\nUnder EU Directive 2011/83/EU (Consumer Rights Directive), once a retailer receives returned goods, they are legally required to process the refund within 14 days. We are now approaching this deadline, and I have yet to receive any update or my refund of €376.02.\n\nI kindly ask you to:\n1. Confirm the exact date you received the packages\n2. Provide a clear timeline for when the refund will be processed\n\nIf the refund is not issued within the legal timeframe, I will be forced to escalate this matter by filing a complaint with the European Consumer Centre (ECC Belgium) and initiating a chargeback through my payment provider.\n\nI trust this can be resolved promptly and amicably.\n\nBest regards,\nYouness Rami.\r\n",
