  "description_text": "\r\nHello,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in purchasing the VAM Pro Set (3 haptic reactors) from your website.\r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed that the included power supply appears to have a plug that is not compatible with European (French) outlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you offer a European version (EU/FR plug) of the power supply, or if it can be purchased separately?\r\nWhether the VAM haptic motors are compatible with the SimJack pedals, or if a special configuration is required to make them work together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help and reply.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
