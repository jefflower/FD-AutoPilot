  "description_text": "Simsonn Support,\r\n\r\nA couple of months ago I purchased your Pro X pedals off of Amazon and like\r\nthem very much. Two weeks ago I ordered your VAM haptic feedback motors\r\nwith power supply and the newest version of your pedal control box made for\r\nthe Pro X Ultra pedals so that I could run the VAM motors. When I connected\r\neverything, powered up the control box, and then went into the\r\nSimsonn Manager software the pedals show as \"disconnected\" and cannot be\r\nconfigured. I swapped back to my original control box and the pedals are\r\ndetected and work, but have no vibration. Right now I'm using version 2.0.5\r\nof your manager software. Is there a firmware update that I need to do to\r\nget this working?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJames Wade\r\n\r\n",
