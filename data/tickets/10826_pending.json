  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to seek assistance with my Pedals Pro that I purchased from\r\nAliExpress approximately one month ago. The pedals worked perfectly fine\r\nfor the first month, but they have suddenly stopped functioning entirely.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out to inquire about the following:\r\n\r\n1. Does the warranty cover units purchased through AliExpress, and if so,\r\nwhat is the process for filing a warranty claim?\r\n\r\n2. Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd recommend I try before\r\nproceeding with a warranty claim? I want to make sure it's not something\r\nsimple I can resolve on my own.\r\n\r\n3. If the issue requires repair or replacement, what would be the next\r\nsteps?\r\n\r\nI've been very satisfied with the product up until this point, so I'm\r\nhoping we can get this resolved. Please let me know what information you\r\nneed from me to assist with this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Jan Meyer,    I can see that your pedals were purchased in April 2024, which means they are now outside the 1-year warranty period. Please record a video showing the issue and upload it to Google Drive, then send me the link and set the sharing permission to “Anyone with the link can view.” This will help us identify the cause and provide the best solution.  If your device is running v1.7.1, please download and install SIMSONN Manager 2.1.3 first. The software may show a message like “version too old.” In that case, please manually update the firmware via: Settings → Update → Manual firmware update → pedals → firmware → pedals-plus.sfu.  After the firmware update, please recalibrate the pedals and test again to confirm whether the readings return to normal.         https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
