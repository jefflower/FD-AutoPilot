Can you share the holes measurements?\r\n\r\nI am also interested in adding bass shakers, so knowing the total dimension\r\nof the base plate, and the height of the heel rest spacers would be useful.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",

I know how to change them on the physical pedal, but what is this\r\nsetting?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nChanho\r\n\r\nOn Mon, 22 Sept 2025, 23:25 service@simsonn.com, ",

Once the maximum force (kg) is configured in the software, any force exceeding this value will not be recognised. We recommend performing manual calibration first before setting an appropriate value.",
