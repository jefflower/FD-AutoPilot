If the firmware version is 1.7.1, we recommend updating to SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0. If the software indicates that the version is too old, you can manually upgrade the firmware by navigating to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-plus.sfu.      https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
