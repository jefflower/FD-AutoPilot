  "description_text": "Hello! \r\n\r\nI got my brother these pedals for Christmas for his sim rig. He has an Xbox and I have a PC and he wanted these pedals because he used mine.. Well I did not check if they were compatible with Xbox and something told me to check when I got them out of the box.. I can provide pictures if you’d like but they were unused / unmounted and only taken out of the box. I can send everything back in the original packaging. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nNate \r\n\r\n\r\n",
