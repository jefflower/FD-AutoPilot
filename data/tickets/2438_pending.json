  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI’m planning to order the black Plus X pedal set around August 12th and wanted to confirm availability.\r\nCould you please let me know if the Germany warehouse will have the black version in stock at that time?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to ensure that the order ships from within the EU so that no VAT or customs charges apply in Austria.\r\n\r\nThank you for confirming — I’m ready to place my order as soon as I have this information.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDiart Tahiri\r\n\r\n",
