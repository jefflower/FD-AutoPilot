A green icon means the power is successfully connected. You can test the vibration function directly on this screen.  If the device is not shown as connected, try reconnecting the USB and power cables. Make sure to plug in the USB first, then the power, to ensure proper initialization.         Please make sure you are using SimHub version 9.9.3 to ensure full compatibility and feature support. ",
