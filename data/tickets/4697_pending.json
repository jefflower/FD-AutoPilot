  "description_text": "I placed an order a few weeks ago for your Pro X Ultra pedals, i chose\r\nexpress shipping at the checkout because it said delivery would take 3-8\r\ndays, i am now on day 22 and still no sign of the pedals, you sent the\r\nhaptic motors 4 days ago (just left outside front door) but they are pretty\r\nuseless without the pedals. I've paid an extra £20 to get express shipping\r\nand i dont know why because it is very poor and the tracking system is\r\nawful and unclear, if my pedals dont arrive by sunday then i want a refund\r\nand you can cancel the delivery i've had the week off work to wait for this\r\ndelivery and if they are not here by sunday there will be no-one here next\r\nweek to take the delivery.\r\n\r\n",
