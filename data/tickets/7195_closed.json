  "description_text": "Good day,\r\nPlease kindly supply status update for my order(#SSN3791 Confirmed Nov 23).\r\nordered 11/23 and no status updated since.  Kindly advise trackingand perhaps origin location.\r\nI am aware of the seasonal \"high traffic\" with shipping anything this time of year.  I just get a bit nervous when this much time has past with no updates (no tracking, no advise of delays or other).\r\nI look forward to an update soon as I have sold my previous pedal set to help pay for this one and currently have none.\r\nThank you in advance for your time.\r\nBest regards,\r\nJames \"Tim\" Talbert\r\n\r\n\r\n",
