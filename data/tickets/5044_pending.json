So I would like to add the Carbon Fiber Heel Plate. But I need to know its dimensions especially the position and size of the screw holes : I need to know if it's compatible with my pedals base. Are the screws provides with the Carbon Fiber Heel Plate, if yes what kind of screws please ? - The 7+R shifter is too far away for my daughter, so I think about the Desktop Fixed (Shifters), it seems to fix the shifter from the side, but is it possible with a shifter build in a cylinder ? Best regards. Michael Buet \r\n\r\n",
