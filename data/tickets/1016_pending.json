This firmware will disable the 4th axis.          You also need to perform an Offset adjustment — please click the Offset button in the top right corner of the software.      Our software currently supports 10 games. May I ask which game you are using now? We are continuously working to add telemetry support for more titles. In the meantime, you can use the internal version of SimHub that I’ve provided. The official release is still undergoing testing and may take a bit more time.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrSbAvCC5iyx9XgdRgSQV-hWpmDGkujc/view?usp=sharing",
