I see that the shipping time is listed as 8–12 days, but I’d\r\nlike to confirm whether this is the total delivery time or if additional\r\nhandling time is required before the order is shipped.\r\n\r\nCould you please clarify how long the processing usually takes before an\r\norder is dispatched?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n",
