  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI purchased 2 haptic pro motors via aliexpress alongside the plus x pedals.\r\nThe pedals are working fine, but none of the motors are working. I tried\r\nboth of the motors in all 3 of the possible holes, but none of them\r\nvibrated when pressing the button in the simsonn software. Is there\r\nanything that I can do about this? Or can I get a replacement sent? Is the\r\nissue with the motors or the control box?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nCas\r\n\r\n",
