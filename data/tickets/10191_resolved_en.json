  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Support,\n\nI recently purchased a used set of Simsonn pedals (throttle, clutch,\nbrake). The throttle and clutch work perfectly, but the brake pedal does\nnot register any input in Windows (joy.cpl), your software, or DiView.\n\nI’ve already tested multiple USB ports, rebooted, and confirmed the brake\nnever shows signal while the other two pedals do, so I believe the load\ncell or internal brake wiring has failed.\n\nCould you let me know:\n\nIf you sell a replacement brake load cell or brake pedal assembly for this\npedal set\n\nPricing and availability\n\nAny part number or compatibility details I should know before ordering\n\nI really like the pedals overall and would prefer to keep using them if\npossible.\n\nThanks for your time,\nBrendan",

After the update, the pedals will support the new software. Please test the brake pedal again.  If your pedals are version 1.7.0, you will need to use FreeJoy to calibrate the pedals, and some settings may need to be manually restored.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
