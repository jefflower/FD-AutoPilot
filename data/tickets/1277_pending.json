  "description_text": "Hi I was wondering if you can help me I purchased simsonn x pro ultras with haptics the delivery was quick until it got to Great Britain it stuck at castle donnington GB it's been there since the fourth  it was supposed to be delivered to me on the 4th so could you look into it for me to find out the reason why it's stuck there. It says it will let me know when the delivery date but it's been like that since the fourth. I research on the place is only got a one-star rating\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: SIMSONN <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSent: 01 July 2025 11:29\r\nTo: www.deanos06@hotmail.com <www.deanos06@hotmail.com>\r\nSubject: A shipment from order #SSN1892 is on the way\r\n\r\nSIMSONN<https://www.simsonn.com/_t/c/v3/AABIQbUcdb-ooYu6WsJRgWshezPbZ5ZlxkfoJLhJoq4VQMBKkLmQNivTzmg-m9TyD-H0rK_vpnheDJqnA7hcmEreBNqfhGVsdYX9nCzlYpHhIXzBQbe5HJ4sfW09171wUqoElg8du0Hv85kMoY7RMBw4zIkpN6pbmZBo6ZkCEDjmSgPZtAAO17J2fSRLrc1Vj_kFfXjUG-cE9X5Wwj9ND49rZl99r1pTnoBePN8DlodC1k8h2lhXdfxDPva3wnIPXS681jNSL_mqL0LFjgAZU9b-GwbBlF8n1O7bsoo01_puA0CbR4IKlkEBT0lcYqORVF8PXsp8cxxyf9SuHZgd>\r\nOrder #SSN1892\r\nYour order is on the way\r\n\r\nYour order is on the way.
