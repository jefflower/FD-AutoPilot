After connecting the device, if you see a message saying “Version too old, not supported” or Simsonn Flasher mode, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, make sure to recalibrate the pedals, as they will not function properly in games without calibration.      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",

You can only use the SimConfigPedals v3.5 software for configuration and operation.          https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download  ​   You can also download FreeJoy 1.7.0 and use the recovery file to restore the pedals.   ​   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnHNudj0VhE6xr7ypu-KeEDuVrlVHVg9/view?usp=drive_link  ​   ​   If you are not comfortable performing the operation yourself, you can install the ToDesk software. Registration is not required — if it prompts you to register, simply click the close button in the upper-right corner to skip.  Once installed, please provide us with your ID and temporary password, and let us know a convenient time in your local city. We will then remotely assist you with the inspection and recovery.   ​   https://dl.todesk.com/windows/ToDesk_Setup.exe",
