Also, after any mechanical or damper adjustments, please confirm whether you have used the Offset function to re-zero the initial signal. Additionally, please check whether the RJ11 4P4C connector on the brake pedal is loose. Have you secured the power cable with cable ties to prevent movement or poor contact? ",

Could you please take a photo or short video of the side of the brake pedal and the mounting bracket?
