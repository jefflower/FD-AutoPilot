  "description_text": "Hello,\nmy name is Dmitry. I’m from Russia.\n3 months ago I bought Simsonn Pro X Ultra Sim Racing Pedals on our local\nmarketplace called Ozon. I bought it from official SIMSONN seller (the\nseller has special mark/sign which confirms it’s official).\nI’m pretty happy with these pedals; Pedals are amazing, thank you a lot!\nNow on SIMSONN official website I can see “Simsonn HS Pro Shifter the H/SQ\nDual-Mode Racing Simulation Shifter” available for pre-sale. I fell in love\nwith it and really want to buy it.\nI think there is no option for Russians to order anything via SIMSONN\nofficial website, because there is no such an option for suitable payment\nsystem. Turns out it is very convenient for us to buy Simsonn stuff via\nOzon marketplace.\nSo, I have a question: will Simsonn HS Pro Shifter be represented on Ozon\nmarketplace by any chance? If so, can you say approximate date of HS Pro\nShifter release on Ozon, please?\n\nBest wishes,\nDmitry Sh",
