  "description_text": "Hello,\r\nI have bought a shifter - SIMSONN PC USB 6+R H Simulator Gear Shifter from\r\nyour shop and received it on 2025-12-06. Today I was playing a rally sim\r\nand somehow it got stuck. It seems that the shifter mechanism jumped out of\r\nthe gated area and damaged the internals of it. Now the PC does not\r\nrecognize it anymore and it does not come up in the device list. When going\r\nthrough gears, it starts to flash button LEDs rapidly. I included a video\r\nof it acting up.\r\n\r\nPedals are great and work perfectly.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for a refund if possible and would like to send it back\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nM. R.\r\n\r\n",
