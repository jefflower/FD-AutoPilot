      "body_text": "Hi Bram van keeken,    You can try applying a small amount of lubricating oil to the key moving parts as described in the manual. If the noise persists, please remove the throttle’s one-way hydraulic damper — if the squeak disappears afterward, we can send you a new damper as a replacement.  Please note that a slight fluid sound inside the throttle is normal, as it is caused by the internal liquid movement that provides realistic damping feedback. You can also adjust the damping level and stroke range to fine-tune the pedal feel to your preference.",
