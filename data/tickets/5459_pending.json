  "description_text": "Hello. \r\n\r\nI recently ordered your Pro Plus pedals on your Amazon store and I need to order a base plate. Currently they are not available on Amazon. I saw I can order it directly from your site. Does the base plate that is compatible with the Pro Plus pedals come with a heel riser?  If not are they available for this plate?  Please let me know and how to go about ordering both. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nTim Heise\r\n239-682-7492\r\n\r\n",
