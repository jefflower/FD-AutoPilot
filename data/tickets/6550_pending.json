If the pedals get stuck, it’s usually caused by an unreliable ground connection.  You can download the VKB tool to test—it displays the pedal curves. Continuously press the pedals for 1–3 minutes; if the pedals get stuck, the curve will suddenly become a straight line. This helps determine whether the grounding issue is resolved.  If it turns out to be a problem with the main control box, we will replace it with a new one. However, in most cases, the issue is due to poor grounding.       https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/pages/downloads",

This will solve the issue of the control box lacking a screw mounting point.    Also, the cables seem thick and hard to secure.
