  "description_text": "\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI did not use my pedals for a few months and then connected them today. \r\nThey seemed to be working fine, but when trying to calibrate it timed \r\nout on sending out the calibration to the pedals. The inputs were all \r\nworking fine. Since there were both updates for the pedals and the \r\nsoftware I did both: the software update for the manager went find. The \r\npedal update stood very long (5minutes?) on 100% and then said \"upgrade \r\ncompleted\".\r\n\r\nI restarted my PC and from then on I was not able to connect the pedals \r\nanymore and they showed up with the error in the image in the device \r\nmanager in Windows. The pedals are connected with the original USB cable \r\nto the PC and I tried different ports, but also another cable. The power \r\nto the pedals was disconnected after the restart of the PC when they did \r\nnot show up as connected as one of the troubleshooting steps.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do? I can't use the pedals like this.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMatthias\r\n\r\n",
