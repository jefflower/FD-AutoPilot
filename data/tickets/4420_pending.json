I was thinking about getting this 3d printed locally, will it work?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6905682\r\n\r\nIf not, could you let me know what dimensions I should ask for, like width and fastener spacing - so I can have an exact fit printed?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nKonstantin\r\n\r\n",
