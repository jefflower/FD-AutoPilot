  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Jami Heiman, a karting driver from Finland. I have been involved\r\nin karting for 16 years, and my achievements include:\r\n\r\n- 2 Finnish Karting Association Championships\r\n- X30 Series Championship\r\n- Several regional titles\r\n- X30 ranking #1 in 2016\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season, I compete in the iRacing series, where my goal is\r\nto achieve a national championship title.\r\n\r\nI am particularly interested in SIMSONN products, as they offer excellent\r\nquality and value for money. I believe that Finland would be an ideal\r\nmarket for SIMSONN — Finnish consumers are known for valuing durability and\r\nsmart spending.\r\n\r\nI would like to offer you an opportunity to partner with me for the 2026\r\nseason, where SIMSONN would support my racing career. In return, I can\r\nprovide brand visibility in both the karting and simracing communities:\r\n\r\nKarting races attract 100–200 competitors and an audience of 4,000–6,000\r\nviewers (on-site and via YouTube live streams).\r\n\r\nMy iRacing series videos receive an average of around 1,000 views per race.\r\n\r\nI believe that our partnership would bring mutual benefits: your brand\r\nwould gain exposure in both the karting and simracing communities, while I\r\nwould gain the opportunity to continue developing my career as a\r\ncompetitive driver.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to discuss in more detail what I can offer as part of this\r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJami Heiman\r\n? jamiheiman74@gmail.com\r\nInstagram: Jami Heiman\r\nFacebook: Jami Heiman official\r\n\r\n",
