      "body_text": "你好，Daniel Rodziewicz，    Please make sure you are using SIMSONN Manager version 2.1.0. The vibration strength must be adjusted strictly according to the software settings. In most cases, motor damage occurs because the strength level was set too high. Also, the parameters in SimHub 9.9.3 should be referenced and kept consistent.  Important notes:    Do not use continuous vibration telemetry such as speed or rpm, as these signals may damage the VAM motor.    VAM Pro is not affected, since its motor design allows continuous operation.    By design, the VAM motor cannot operate at continuous high intensity.    Please cross-test the VAM motors. If they are confirmed damaged, we will send you 2 replacement motors. However, it is essential that you always follow the maximum strength limits set in the software to prevent further damage.            In addition, please provide your order number, contact person, phone number, and address so that we can assist you with the next steps. ",

This was then dropped to around 35% all was working fine until it just stopped.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that I hadn't used the clutch pedal motor. It was plugged in and set up but nothing was assigned to it as I don't use the clutch pedal. I only noticed it didn't work when i was testing the motor /black box yesterday.\r\n\r\nYes. All apps are fully updates and lates versions installed.\r\n\r\nMy details are below.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder #SSN2378\r\nMr Daniel Rodziewicz\r\n1 Yaxley Place\r\nNewstead\r\nStoke on trent\r\nStaffordshire\r\nST3 3LJ\r\nUK\r\n\r\n07449899511\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",
