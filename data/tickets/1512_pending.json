      "body_text": "Hi Justin Olsen,     There are typically only a few reasons for USB disconnection issues:    Using a USB hub, which can cause unstable connections;    Not plugging the device into a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC case;    A loose or frequently wobbled USB connection;    If you're using a Fanatec or Moza base, lack of proper grounding to your PC case can also cause USB dropouts due to EMI.    We recommend turning off your wheelbase and leaving it off for an hour to observe whether the USB disconnection still occurs. Meanwhile, check SIMSONN Manager to see if your device is still sending output signals—this can help determine whether the issue is hardware-related. The HB Pro hardware is highly reliable and very unlikely to fail under normal conditions.      Here are the recommended solutions for interference mitigation:  1. Ensure your PC is properly grounded to a reliable household ground. Some wall outlets have only two wires and no ground line. This not only poses a safety risk but also prevents electromagnetic interference from devices like Fanatec from being properly discharged.  2. Use a wire to connect the metal housing of the rig or base to the PC case. This helps establish a shielding path and improves overall interference resistance.     3.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.  ​   4. Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.  ​   https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting  ​   https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding  ​   Additionally, our device is CE EMI certified and does not emit electromagnetic interference to external equipment. ",
