  "description_text": "Hi, I received my simsonn plus x pedal this week. I was wondering if there's a way to make the pedal travel longer. Currently the brake pedal travel about half an inch when pressed. I was something that matches regular road cars. I have not changed anything, so still setup the way it came from Simsonn. Any help is appreciated. Thanks,Anil\r\n",
