At the moment\r\nI'm using the Logitech G923 for iracing, but I think the pedals can be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nI only need a throttle and brake pedal without a baseplate since I want to\r\ncreate one my own.\r\n\r\nWhat are your cheapest options? And do you have some goos promotion? I live\r\nin the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your advice.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJoey van der Linden\r\n\r\n",
