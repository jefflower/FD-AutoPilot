Here’s what you can do: please update the firmware again, then reconfigure the offset, and finally test whether the pedal is functioning normally.      Please follow the steps below:    Press and hold the upgrade button on the PlusX main controller, then reconnect the USB cable.    Open SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 and check if it has entered recovery mode.    If recovery mode is detected, go to Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.    After the update is complete, test the device to see if it has been restored successfully.",
