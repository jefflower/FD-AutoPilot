Consider these tips, based on our customers’ 2024 BFCM email marketing results. \r\n - Start your campaign on Monday or Tuesday, as shoppers often spend more per order earlier in the week. Definitely send an email on Wednesday. \r\n- Send on Black Friday and Cyber Monday — they’re table stakes. \r\n- Ensure welcome and abandoned checkout emails are activated. They generated higher conversion rates and average order values than BFCM newsletters. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n [Image \"BFCM_2024_email_marketing_results.png?expires=1775078550&amp;signature=1bb1f40644e358ce2419cfc0363499214bfebc95841045d28d30dc9bb15a387a&amp;req=dSgmFs56m4deW%2FMW2XS%2Fid6Tf8YGVSD9H1STeskkHgVRYnmB7Q4%3D%0A\"] \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Get more data insights \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n ?
