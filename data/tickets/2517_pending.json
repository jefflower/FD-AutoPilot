  "description_text": "Hi!  We are very interested in your Plus X pedal set but can't figure out if it is compatible with the Trak Racer TR80s sim rig.  Additionally, if it is compatible, do we need the baseplate or can the pedals be attached directly to the TR80s?  Please advise at your earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\nThank you -\r\nEric Altman\r\n\r\n",
