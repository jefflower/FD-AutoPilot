  "description_text": "Good evening,\r\nI received my pedals today and after connecting to the manager, an upgrade\r\nwas done.\r\nMy first problem is that I cannot control the led's with the manager. If I\r\nsync, the manager gets the configuration from the pedals, that's it.\r\nOn the manager, I change colors or modes, even trying to turn them off,\r\nand nothing happens on the pedals side (just the same mode that started\r\nwhen I first connected the pedals).\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that with Simhub the pedals are detected as the Haptics\r\nand not as pedals, even when I still do not have the haptics. Is\r\nthis normal?\r\nThe haptics I will just buy if the pedals are a good choice for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation. I tried on the website to register my\r\nproduct but I found nothing. Is there a link to add my product to my\r\naccount?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexandre Cardoso\r\n\r\n",

But after installation\r\nI don't know how to update the firmware again because it was done before\r\nand I don't know where I can download the file to make it manually. Your\r\nwebsite has little information about software.\r\nThe issue remains the same as before.\r\n\r\nI just made exactly the same as I made before. Excluding the firmware\r\nupdate, that I know from experience, we should not be flashing it all the\r\ntime. My system is very stable but the led control of the pedals is really\r\nnot working.\r\n\r\nThe manual of the pedals is also very limited when concerning the led\r\nconnections and diagnostic.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexandre Cardoso\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Nov 9, 2025 at 4:21 AM service@simsonn.com ",
