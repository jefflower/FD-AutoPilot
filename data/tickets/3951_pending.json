  "description_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nI bought the 3 pedal set of the  plus X pedals on AliExpress from your\r\nofficial store 3 months ago. They worked great till now. As you can see in\r\nthe picture below, they show up disconnected, even though they aren't. How\r\ncan I fix this? Note that the Windows USB (dis-)connect sound does play\r\nevery time I (dis-)connect them. They are directly plugged into my laptop.\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nWillem Beel\r\n\r\n",
