Click \"Read Config from Device\" to enter the Axis interface to calibrate the pedals. Click \"Start Calibration,\" pull the handbrake a few times with normal force, then click \"Stop Calibration.\" Next, click \"Write Config to Device.\" After this, test whether the progress bar can reach 100%. Once confirmed, you can enter the game and bind the pedals.             https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnHNudj0VhE6xr7ypu-KeEDuVrlVHVg9/view?usp=drive_link",
