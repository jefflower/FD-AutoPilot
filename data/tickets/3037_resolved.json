  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nToday I noticed when trying to re-calibrate my Simsonn Pro X Ultra  pedals that when I try to assign a button ingame it registeres RX+ or RX- as input without me pressing anything at all.\r\n\r\nWhen I check in the Simsonn software everything seems right, no loadcell fluctuation no nothing at all, I tried grounding the rig and using separate power but nothing seems to help, any other things that I can try?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCosmin.\r\n\r\n",
