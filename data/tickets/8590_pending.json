  "description_text": "Greetings, I bought a stainless steel handbrake a few years ago and recently had a problem with the load cell. Because of this, I purchased a new component, but I didn't pay attention to the connector for the old cell. Right now, I need the electrical diagram information to crimp it correctly.\r\n\r\nCould you also tell me the connector specification? I couldn't find it near where I live, maybe I'll have to order it online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
