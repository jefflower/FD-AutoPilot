      "body_text": "Hi Edward Melendez,    I reviewed the previous emails. Your wife placed the order on December 3 and contacted us on December 6. We may not have seen the email in time, and the order had already been shipped from the US warehouse, so it could not be intercepted.  Additionally, since the pedals weigh over 10kg, shipping via FedEx is very expensive. If returned, the round-trip shipping cost would exceed the product’s value, especially the return shipping. Therefore, you might consider reselling the unopened product on a local Canadian platform, which could be faster than waiting for delivery from Canada.",

Since iron products are prone to scratches and other signs of use, we are typically unable to resell them. If your product is in perfect condition, you may return the package to our US warehouse. We will process your refund after receiving and inspecting the item. However, please ensure the packaging is intact and the product shows no signs of use—otherwise, your return request will not be approved!
