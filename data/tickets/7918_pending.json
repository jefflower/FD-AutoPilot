They work for 20 or 30 minutes then they\r\nget stuck vibrating and only leaving them switched off for a day clears the\r\nproblem. The problem returns when using the next day. Re-starting the PC\r\nand power does not help.\r\n\r\nAlso the control box sparks when the power is connected (see attached video\r\ncontrol box)\r\n\r\nAnt one of the haptic motors also gives out a loud audible humming noise\r\nwhen not in use (only one of the motors does this).\r\n(see attached file - haptic buzz 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nR Jones\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Richard Jones,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

Also, take a screenshot of the configuration interface in SIMSONN Manager. If the grounding is proper, disconnection issues should not occur. You can also use SimHub for telemetry monitoring.      Additionally, if you encounter disconnection issues, please make sure to connect the computer case, the control box casing, and the pedal’s metal screws together with a single wire for grounding. This can effectively prevent disconnections or interference. ",
