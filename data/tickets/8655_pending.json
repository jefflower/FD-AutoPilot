  "description_text": "Hi i purchased a Simsonn GT2 Racing Simulator Steering Wheel S1 wheel last\r\nweek .\r\nThe shifter on the left hand side , the base is firmly connected to the\r\nbutton box . But the paddle itself is very loose. I have tried to tighten\r\nthe allen keys to see if that would cure it . but it still slides in and\r\nout and up and down. The right one is solid. Do I have to return the hole\r\nwheel  or can you just send a replacement shifter ?\r\n\r\nThanks Anthony Dickens\r\n\r\n",
