      "body_text": "Hi Martin Fredriksson,  Please uninstall the SIMSONN Manager currently installed on your PC, then download and install SIMSONN Manager v2.1.3 from our official website. (Even if your local version shows 2.1.3, the official download has a fix applied.) After that, please recalibrate the HS Pro. During calibration, please ignore whether the gear shown on the screen looks correct. Just follow the calibration sequence strictly: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → R. Once calibration is completed, 7th and Reverse will be mapped correctly. This was a mapping bug on our side, and it has been fixed in the official website build. ",
