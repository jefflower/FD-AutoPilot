I thought\r\nthe controller had given out since all three stopped at the same time, so I\r\nwent ahead and purchased a new controller.\r\n\r\nHowever, after receiving and testing I still have the same issue. So I\r\nthink my problem is the motor instead. What’s the best route to get these\r\nreplaced? I’m in Canada.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nGuilherme D. Martins\r\n\r\n",

Please make sure you are using SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2; in the vibration interface, the power should show as connected. But if testing the vibration has no response, try connecting each VAM motor individually for testing. In theory, it’s impossible for all three VAMs to be damaged at the same time. ",
