  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am not too sure what happened, my brake pedal just died on me. In the\r\nsoftware it shows it's continuous at 100%, i have readjusted the\r\ncables/wires multiple times but the issue has not been resolved.\r\n\r\nHow much would a replacement pedal cost me? I only need 1x Braked pedal as\r\nmy Throttle and Clutch are working fine.\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRyan H.\r\n\r\n",
