  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn support,\r\n\r\nI’m considering to purchase a Simsonn pedal set but a bit hesitating of the connectivity in regards of iRacing. This is the sim I spent almost every of my simulator time and based on my best understanding iRacing is not providing outputs for wheel spin, ABS, TC, etc. to avoid any cheating possibilties.\r\nThus my question: is your VAM solution working with iRacing as well somehow despite that iRacing is pretty limited in this regard, please?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nAndras Laszlo Kovacs\r\n\r\n",
