Once they arrive, I’ll be testing them on my sim racing YouTube channel and, if I’m truly satisfied, I will create a detailed review video.\r\n\r\nSince my content focuses heavily on sim racing hardware and honest product reviews, I wanted to ask if you would be open to potential collaboration, especially regarding product testing, reviews, or long-term use of your products on my channel.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time. I’m looking forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nNico Daucher/ Neyko Racing\r\n\r\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@NeykoRacingInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/neykoracingTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/neykoracingTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@neykoracing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We’d be happy to explore a potential partnership with you — just not at this very moment. Our team is currently fully occupied and we’re unable to take on new collaboration projects right away. Once the timing is right, we’ll definitely be open to discussing possibilities together.  In the meantime, we hope you’ll really enjoy your new pedals. If you have any questions, need assistance, or run into anything at all, please feel free to contact us anytime — we’re always here to help.     Best regards, The Simsonn Team",
