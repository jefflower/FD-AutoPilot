This is necessary because adjusting the damping or mechanical components changes the initial position, so the Offset needs to be recalibrated for accurate readings. ",

Next, click the Offset button and recalibrate the pedals. Finally, you can also set the dead zones for the minimum and maximum pedal values.",
