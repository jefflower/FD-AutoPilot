I’m thinking about buying Simsonn Plus X (\r\nhttps://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-plus-x-pedals?variant=51288365138234),\r\nbut I want to make sure they ship to Chile first.\r\n\r\nIf these pedals can be shipped to Chile, I’d like to know whether I only\r\nhave to pay the shipping cost shown on the website, or if there are any\r\nadditional charges like taxes, customs fees, or import duties. In the past,\r\nI’ve been told I only needed to pay for shipping when buying things from\r\nabroad, but then I ended up being charged more than what I was originally\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n",
