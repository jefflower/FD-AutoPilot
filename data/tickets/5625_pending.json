  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Marketing/Sales Team,\r\n\r\nMy name is *Daniel Carvalho*, and I am currently part of your *Brand\r\nAmbassador Program*. I’ve been proudly promoting Simsonn products and would\r\nlike to explore the possibility of developing a *closer partnership* with\r\nyour team.\r\n\r\nFrom *January 1st to November 4th, 2024*, my performance in the program has\r\nbeen as follows:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   209 referrals\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   2 orders\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   0.96% conversion rate\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   $371.95 in total sales\r\n\r\nI was one of the first users of Simsonn in Portugal, back when the brand\r\nwas still largely unknown here. My current setup includes:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Pro P2-H2 Pedals (currently upgrading to the new PRO X Ultra)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Simsonn HB Pro Racing Simulator Handbrake\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Simsonn SQ Pro Racing Simulator Sequential Shifter\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Simsonn Racing Simulator Leather Steering Wheel (purchased via\r\n   AliExpress)\r\n\r\nIn short, my simracing bundle is mostly composed of Simsonn products, which\r\nshows the trust and enthusiasm I have for your brand.\r\n\r\nI also create content and stream on *Twitch (DanielCarvalho_14\r\n<https://www.twitch.tv/danielcarvalho_14>)*. Although my channel is still\r\nsmall, it has been growing steadily – over 25% follower growth in the last\r\n6 months, even with limited streaming frequency.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, on my *TikTok (DanielCarvalho_14\r\n<https://www.tiktok.com/@danielcarvalho_14>)*, I have posted two unboxing\r\nvideos of your Simsonn HB Pro and Simsonn SQ Pro products, entirely on my\r\nown initiative. These videos have attracted good engagement and interest\r\nwithin the Portuguese and Spanish simracing communities.\r\n\r\nSince I was among the first to introduce Simsonn to the Iberian market\r\n(Portugal and Spain), I truly believe there’s a strong opportunity to\r\nincrease the brand’s visibility and reputation in this region.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I would like to propose a potential collaboration,\r\npossibly involving receiving and testing new Simsonn products. I’m\r\nparticularly interested in the *Simsonn VAM*, which I believe would appeal\r\nstrongly to my audience.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and consideration. I’d be glad to discuss\r\nany ideas on how we can strengthen Simsonn’s presence in Portugal and Spain\r\n(Iberia) together.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n*Daniel Carvalho* Twitch: DanielCarvalho_14\r\n<https://www.twitch.tv/danielcarvalho_14>\r\nTikTok: DanielCarvalho_14 <https://www.tiktok.com/@danielcarvalho_14>\r\nEmail: dcarvalho96.dc@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",
