I am ordering the Simsonn Plux x pedals to sweden.\r\nSpecifically the ”Plus X P2-H2 Black without Baseplate”.\r\n\r\nWill the pedals automatically be shipped from Germany so there will be no import tax?\r\n\r\nAre there yellow, red, blue or green springs for the break pedal included in the Plux X package? Or do you have to buy all springs separate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
