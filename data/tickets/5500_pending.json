The Package I was given only had 2 pedals - My grandmother was certain she bought 3 pedals. She is not tech savy at all and feels as if I’m ungrateful for her gift.\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out for some help on this issue - Thank you so much again for your time and consideration!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nKyle Barretto\r\n",
