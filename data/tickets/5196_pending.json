  "description_text": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI placed an order on 10/20 for the Silver Base-plate\r\n(https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-pedal-pro-plus-with-baseplate?variant=50475291476282)\r\nand paid $90.90 after tax and shipping on my Amex (via ApplePay).\r\n\r\nI did not receive a confirmation email from Shop.com nor Simsonn.com\r\nand am unable to see the order placed on either website using my email\r\naddress, pkrengel26@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease confirm the order exists, re-instantiate it in the system, or\r\nrefund me ASAP.  I'd prefer to not need to contact my credit card\r\ncompany regarding this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nPS: I am aware that there was a massive AWS outage on Monday which\r\ncould be related, I am very interested in receiving the product but am\r\nworried about the payment with missing order.\r\n\r\n",
