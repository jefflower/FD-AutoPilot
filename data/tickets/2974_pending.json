  "description_text": "I recently bought a set of pro x pedals and have been using them for a\r\nwhile now with no issue, just a few days ago I updated the simsonn software\r\nand now I'm having some issues.\r\nMy PC detects 8 inputs from the pedals and one of them is always centered.\r\nThe clutch LEDs work and I can see the white position line move in the\r\nsoftware when pressed. But no input is detected, no bottom end option on\r\nthe dead zone slider, no movement on the graph.\r\n\r\nI've tried a few things,\r\nplug the gas into the clutch port and vise versa, so it seems to be the\r\nport on the control box not the sensor itself.\r\nRestarts, reinstalls, other software versions.\r\nStill no clutch input.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I could get some help?\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Jack Broome,     Please use the test version 2.1.1 and click Revert → Save, then recalibrate and test again to check whether Axis 4 is disabled. If not, you may try refreshing the firmware manually: go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware, and select the corresponding prox.sfu firmware file. Please avoid using version 2.1.1 for now—we will release an online update soon, as other versions may mistakenly re-enable Axis 4.      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPkeOHREyALtCtNmL87a2WnUDZV0Gx_b/view?usp=drive_link",
