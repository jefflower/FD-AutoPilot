  "description_text": "Hello, I ordered the above pedals about a month ago from your ebay store.\r\nThey have been working great until today. I attempted to calibrate them\r\ntoday within the Simsonn manager software and when I open the manager, I am\r\ngetting a warning which states \"You may be the victim of pirated software.\"\r\nThe pedals are showing as connected within the software but are not\r\nregistering any inputs or allowing me to calibrate or adjust anything. I\r\ntried reinstalling the manager application and checked all power and usb\r\nconnections to the pedals.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help in resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n",
