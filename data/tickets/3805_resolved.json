Once I review the logs, I will be able to quickly identify and resolve the issue. Alternatively, you can install the ToDesk tool, and I can check it remotely for you — the fix usually takes only a short time. Normally, users in other regions do not encounter this issue.      Please install the Todesk software. No registration is required, and if it prompts you to register, simply close the window.      https://dl.todesk.com/windows/ToDesk_Setup.exe",

Please locate the Simsonn Manager “S” icon on the bottom-left of your desktop, right-click to exit the program, and then launch the new 2.1.1 software. If you are not sure how to do this, you can first uninstall the 2.1.0 version from your computer, then install and open the new 2.1.1 version for testing. ",
