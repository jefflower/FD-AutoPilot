  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nMy name is Alessandro and I run *Xander Racing*, a YouTube channel focused\r\nentirely on sim racing, driving simulators, and sim hardware.\r\n\r\nThe channel counts *33,000+ subscribers and over 8 million views*, with a\r\nhighly targeted audience mainly based in Italy. My followers are deeply\r\ninterested in high-quality sim racing equipment, from pedals to steering\r\nwheels and complete simulator setups.\r\n\r\nI’m reaching out because I believe Simsonn products would be a great fit\r\nfor my channel and community. In particular, I would love to feature\r\nproducts such as the *Simsonn Pedal Pro X Ultra* and/or the *Simsonn GT2\r\nRacing Simulator Steering Wheel S1*, showcasing them through dedicated\r\nvideos and real gameplay use, with honest and experience-based feedback.\r\n\r\nMy goal is always to create content that is informative, authentic, and\r\nuseful for sim racers who are considering upgrading their setups, while\r\noffering brands meaningful and credible exposure. I’ve previously worked\r\nwith companies such as *Simagic, Conspit, Pimax, HTC Vive, PXN, MOZA,\r\nFanatec and Next Level Racing*, focusing on long-term, mutually beneficial\r\ncollaborations.\r\n\r\nI’d be happy to discuss possible ways to work together.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nAlessandro Petruio\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply.\r\n\r\nYes, of course. A collaboration format that works particularly well with my\r\nchannel is a *dedicated YouTube video* focused on hands-on usage of your\r\nproducts.The video would include real gameplay, setup impressions, and an\r\nhonest, experience-based review from a sim racer’s perspective.\r\n\r\nMy audience is made up of highly engaged sim racing enthusiasts, many of\r\nwhom actively invest in hardware upgrades and follow the channel\r\nspecifically to discover and evaluate new sim racing products. For this\r\nreason, the visibility would be extremely targeted and relevant for a brand\r\nlike Simsonn.\r\n\r\nAlongside the YouTube video, I would also include a *short-form vertical\r\nreview *(60–90 seconds) published as a Reel/Short/TikTok. This format\r\nusually performs very well in terms of reach and engagement, helping to\r\namplify the exposure beyond the long-form video while still reaching a very\r\nsim racing–focused audience.\r\n\r\nThis combination allows for both in-depth product presentation and fast,\r\nhigh-impact visibility within a very niche and passionate sim racing\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI’m happy to discuss product selection, timing, and any specific goals you\r\nmay have.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nIl giorno lun 12 gen 2026 alle ore 10:49 service@simsonn.com <\r\nservice@simsonn.com> ha scritto:\r\n\r\n> Hi Alessandro Petruio,\r\n>\r\n> Do you have any suggested collaboration methods?\r\n>\r\n> On Thu, 8 Jan at 6:13 PM , Alessandro Petruio <contact.xracing@gmail.com>\r\n> wrote:\r\n> Hello Simsonn Team,\r\n> My name is Alessandro and I run *Xander Racing*, a YouTube channel\r\n> focused entirely on sim racing, driving simulators, and sim hardware.\r\n> The channel counts *33,000+ subscribers and over 8 million views*, with a\r\n> highly targeted audience mainly based in Italy.
