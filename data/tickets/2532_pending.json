However, when I try mountains with the\r\nthrottle, there’s a plate on the back of the throttle, preventing the\r\nsecond screw from threading through, It’s like the hole is out of\r\nalignment.\r\n\r\nHow do you recommend I get the second screw throw through? Does this back\r\npanel need to come off too? If so, how?\r\n\r\nI’ve attached pictures for you.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n",
