  "description_text": "Hello.\n\nI am trying to setup the pedals and my wheel in iracing but the position\nkeeps moving around and preventing setup.  I did the calibration on simsonn\nmanager v 2.1.0 and it was successful. I also tried adding ferrite clamps\nto everything and connecting pedals directly to pc but I still have the\njittery inputs. Can you please advise if this is grounding or emi issue in\npedals? I also tried isolating the control box with no change.\n\nPlease check the short video showing the jittery input.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/CZPW6QSUvO0?si=ogPPKMcVCunZpJ-0\n\nThank you for your help.",
