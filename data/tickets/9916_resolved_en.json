  "description_text": "Hello,\nI am contacting you regarding a problem with the GT2 steering wheel I purchased from you on January 30, 2025, order number: 3048989491525520.\n\nIt is no longer recognized by my PC.\n\nError message: Unknown USB device (device descriptor request failed).\nI have performed the following tests:\n\n- Tested on a different USB port\n- Tested on a different PC\n- Replaced the USB cable\n- Removed the faulty entry in Device Manager\n- Reset the Windows USB drivers\nIn Device Manager, the steering wheel appears with a VID/VIP:\nVID_0000&PID_0002, regardless of the PC.\n\nHowever, the steering wheel's LEDs light up, so it is receiving power.\n\nSince the steering wheel is still under warranty until January 30, 2026,\nplease send me a replacement, even if I have to replace the parts myself.\n\nThank you in advance for your understanding and assistance.\n\nSincerely,\nGuillaume Lebleu",
