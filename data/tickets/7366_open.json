  "description_text": "Hi. I purchased a handbrake from you guys about 6 months ago. Its worked\r\ngreat however today the 2 bolts that hold in the aluminium block snapped\r\nduring regular use. Someone told me that this happens but I told them they\r\nmust have misused or abused the product and now it happened to me. It has\r\nbeen less than a year of ownership and I dont have the money to replace it\r\nright now. Do you guys sell the parts or upgrades for the bolts that\r\nsnapped?\r\n\r\nU Davis\r\n\r\n",
