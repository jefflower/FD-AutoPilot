  "description_text": "Hi,\r\nRef order number SSN2957. \r\n\r\nMy Plus X pedals arrived on Friday and whilst they appear to work fine electrically, the brake pedal has a little free play at the start which makes it clunky when you start to brake, and after a few hours use it has developed a really horrible, very loud squeak! \r\n\r\nAll bolts etc are tight, already checked that for the clunk. \r\n\r\nCan you please advise what to look at and also which part (if any) needs lubricating and which lubricant to use? \r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nStewart Sanderson\r\n\r\n\r\n",
