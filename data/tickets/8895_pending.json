I’ve had them for a week and they have been fine until today I was going around track when I noticed that they were no longer working. I stopped my practice session to see if they were connected and simhub said they were but I wwws only getting feedback from one pedal (throttle) to exact . What can I do I enjoy your product so much I can’t see myself without them \r\n",
