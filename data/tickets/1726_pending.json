I updated the software and it said there is F1 25 support, but on the games list I don't see F1 25 and the game is not able to assign the pedals to accelerate or brake.\r\n\r\nrespectfully,\r\nNolan\r\n\r\n",

If you are still unable to bind the device, could you please provide a video showing the issue? This will help us identify the problem more quickly and offer an appropriate solution. ",
