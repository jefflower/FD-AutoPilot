This includes fixing issues like robots.txt,\r\nownership verification, page speed, and basic product SEO so that Google\r\ncan properly index your products.\r\n‎\r\n‎Google Merchant Center Setup: I’ll list your products on Google Merchant\r\nCenter and set up Google Shopping campaigns. This ensures your products\r\nappear directly in Google search results when potential buyers are looking\r\nfor items like yours, driving highly targeted traffic.\r\n‎\r\n‎Conversion Improvements: I’ll monitor visitor behavior and make\r\nrecommendations to improve conversion rates, such as better product\r\ndescriptions, trust signals (badges/reviews), and mobile-friendly design\r\ntweaks.\r\n‎\r\n‎Continuous Growth: Once everything is running, I’ll track performance,\r\nrefine the campaigns, and share updates so we keep improving results\r\ntogether.\r\n‎\r\n‎The goal is simple, to bring in more traffic that converts into paying\r\ncustomers, so we both grow together.\r\n‎\r\n‎Would you like me to start with a quick store audit so I can share the top\r\nissues and opportunities I find? and you can kindly share with me your\r\nWhatsApp contacts so I'll be able to send over the audit This will give us\r\na clear starting point.\r\n‎\r\n‎Looking forward to your thoughts!\r\n‎\r\n‎Best regards,\r\n‎Abel\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Sep 16, 2025, 9:10 AM support@simsonn.com ",
