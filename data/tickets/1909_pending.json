  "description_text": "\nHi Simsonn,\n \nI hope you are well.\n \nTweakTown.com are currently looking to expand our review coverage to include sim racing and flight sim hardware.\n \nWe would like to review individual products in detail, just as we do for all other categories, including PC cases, monitors, hardware, and peripherals. This will provide potential buyers with comprehensive and accurate information, and potentially a recommendation from us. As we cover more products, we will be able to offer direct comparisons and possible alternatives as well.\n \nTo give some insight, I have been sim racing seriously since the PS3/GT Academy days. I've run Gran Turismo and iRacing leagues, and still race for fun most days. I started with a Logitech G27, then moved to Thrustmaster, and now personally run a Moza R9, so I have a fair amount of knowledge around sim racing. \n \nEach review we conduct includes Pros and Cons, covering everything from packaging and unboxing through to any applicable software, testing, pricing, and conclusion. The conclusion covers Performance, Quality, Features, and Value, providing a determined overall score and if it is something we would recommend. \n \nI'm based in the UK so any samples would be sent here for review. Please note that samples can be loaned and returned, with the shipping costs covered by you. Some products may require longer-term use for direct comparison, side-by-side photo comparisons, and other purposes. \n \nI hope that gives you an insight into what we would like to cover, if you have any further questions then please let me know.\n \nI look forward to hearing from you.\n \nRegards,\n \nKris\n\r\n",
