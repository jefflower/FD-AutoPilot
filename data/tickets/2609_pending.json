I see on your Amazon.com listing that your merchandise ships \r\nfrom a US warehouse. Do items purchased on your website, simsonn.com, \r\nalso ship from a US warehouse? I am concerned about tariff issues.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTony Fitzgerald\r\n",

The VAM Pro showed as having shipped with the pedals and baseplate with the same tracking number. The VAM Pro 3 piece set has not arrived. Can you tell me if the VAM Pro 3 piece set on amazon also ships from China, and if so, would I receive some sort of tracking there to track it with? My Order number on amazon is 112-9258458-0001834  . Amazon won't allow me to contact you there for some reason. They say they are handling customer service.",
