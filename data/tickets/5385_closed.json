  "description_text": "Hi I ordered a Plus X pedal set and when inspecting the red elastomers it seems like there are tears in it. This causes a weird creaking sound when installed. Switching to the yellow elastomers the sound is gone and the feel is more consistent. Attached below are pictures. Amazon Order #112-3002134-9839416 \r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
