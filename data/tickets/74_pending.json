I ALWAYS FOLLOW\r\nTHE INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nC) Please read my conversation from precious claim (that you stated was\r\nwith sales person). That person told me to try things against the\r\ninstruction LYING!!!! THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE ( basically exposing me\r\nto brake the product). YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT!!!!\r\n\r\nD) I don't want a refund, I got a great deal for it with my discounts from\r\nprevious purchases. I want my product.
