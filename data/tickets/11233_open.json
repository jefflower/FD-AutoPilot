  "description_text": "Hi.\r\n\r\nI am still having issues with my haptics control box. The replacement one that was sent a couple of months ago fixed the disconnecting issues for awhile. It has now started happening again randomly.\r\nAs soon as I disconnect the power plug for the haptic motors the pedals stop randomly disconnecting.\r\n\r\nCan you please advise a solution, I've seen online other people are having these issues as well. Would there be a revised control box coming out?\r\n\r\nRegards Justin\r\n\r\nGet Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n\r\n",
