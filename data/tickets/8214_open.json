  "description_text": "Ich habe meine Pedalen erhalten. Leider ist es so, dass für die Platte keine Distanzscheiben und Schrauben dabei waren. Des weiteren waren für die bremsen keine Plastik Distanzringe dabei, wenn man nicht alle Elastomere nimmt. Des weiteren funktioniert die Kalibrierung nicht. Auch zb wenn ich die Kalibrierung mache, erreiche ich danach nie 100 Prozent beim bremsen... immer dsnn nur bis 36kg also 36 Prozent und somit funktioniert es sehr schlecht. Wie können Sie mir dabei helfen und entgegen kommen, ansonsten möchte ich die Pedalen zurück schicken. MfG Jasper Diekmann",

As requested, I am attaching three new photos to clearly show the current delivery contents and confirm the missing parts. Please note that these photos are in addition to the photos I already sent earlier. Missing parts (confirmed) After checking everything again carefully, the following items are missing from the delivery and were not included at all: -Black spacers (required for pedal mounting) -Spacers and screws for the pedal mounting plate -Grounding / earth cable for the hub/controller Based on the number of missing items, it appears that one complete package was not included in the shipment The spacers and screws visible in some photos are my own parts and were not supplied by SIMSONN. Critical hardware issue – hub/controller defective In addition to the missing parts, there is now a serious hardware failure: The hub/controller is no longer recognized by Windows Windows reports: “USB device not recognized” The power LED starts blinking The hub heats up very quickly, even when: no pedals are connected no motors are connected only the original power supply is used Pedals and motors are no longer detected at all This issue started immediately after the firmware update. Because the hub becomes hot, I have stopped using it for safety reasons. This is not a configuration or software issue on my side. The hub/controller is currently not usable and appears to be defective. Request: Please check my order SSN4248 and arrange the following: Replacement shipment of all missing parts, including: -black spacers -mounting spacers and screws -grounding/earth cable -Replacement of the defective hub/controller (RMA) I purchased the pedals directly from SIMSONN, not via a reseller.

Unfortunately, the delivery is incomplete and several parts are missing. I have attached photos as evidence and referenced the picture numbers below. In this case, the issue is missing parts, not a functional defect. Therefore, it is unfortunately not possible to demonstrate the problem in a video.

The spacers and screws currently shown in the photo are my own parts and were not included in your delivery. The ground wire for the hub/controller is missing, as shown in photo (90).
