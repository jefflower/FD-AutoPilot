  "description_text": "Dear simsonn, \r\n\r\nRecently I bought the plus x pedals. However, I have a huge issue. When plugging the brake wire into the box, it will not work at all. I used the clutch in the brake slot and it works. I tried taking it apart but I realize the wire is all the way enclosed in the sensor box. I am emailing to request a replacement load cell module box. Let me know what information you need from me in order to resolve this issue. It’s incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMatthew Patriak \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This will help determine whether the issue is with the brake pedal itself or the control box. Normally, there shouldn’t be any problem, as all units are tested before shipping. Also, please check if any bracket at the front of the brake pedal is blocking the sensor, preventing it from moving. You can send a photo of the side view of the brake pedal installation, and I will help you check. ",
