      "body_text": "Hi Edoardo Strazzera,  If it’s a PC game, our pedals are compatible with any other brand’s wheel base, as they all work via USB connection to the PC, ensuring full compatibility. Additionally, if you don’t need the haptic motors, no extra power supply is required—the pedals come with a USB cable and all necessary screws, wrenches, and installation accessories. ",
