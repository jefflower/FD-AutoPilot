  "description_text": "Hello I have a set of pro x pedals and I purchased a set of the vam pro haptic reactors.\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing them I saw the note on the website about they are for the ultra and the plus. My question is can I just buy the pro x ultra control box with my pedals?\r\nIt also says I can upgrade the software and control box firmware with my current setup but won't work as well. Is that true? I've tried everything and I can't get them to work, I even tried to use simhub to control them and nothings working.\r\nIf you could let me know what I should do to make them work I'd appreciate it.\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve McCormick\r\nMPG Motorsports\r\n7561 Tyler Blvd Unit 3\r\nMentor OH 44060\r\n440-563-1025\r\nWWW.MPGMOTORSPORTS.COM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n",
