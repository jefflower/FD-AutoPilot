There were no disconnects during the update, and the software reported that the update was successful.\r\nAfter this, all motors now show “power disconnect”, no matter what I do.\r\nI’ve already tried:\r\n\r\n  *\r\nReflashing the firmware again\r\n  *\r\nDisconnecting and reconnecting all cables (power and USB)\r\n\r\nPlease advise on how to proceed, because the vibration motors are now completely unusable.\r\n[cid:2584a4da-7cd4-43b2-81d1-d4ab19c8f14e]\r\nBest regards,\r\nSimen\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFra: service@simsonn.com <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSendt: lørdag 27. september 2025 07:55\r\nTil: simenasphaug@hotmail.com <simenasphaug@hotmail.com>\r\nEmne: Re: Issue with VAM Pro Vibration Motors – Prolonged/Stuck Vibrations\r\n\r\nHi Simen Asphaug,\r\n\r\nIf your pedals are ProX Ultra, please update to the latest software and firmware to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.\r\n\r\nPlease first uninstall SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 from your computer, and then download and install the 2.1.1 version using the provided link.\r\nOnce the installation is complete, go to:\r\nSettings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Select the file pedals-firmware-pedals-proxultra.sfu\r\nAfter the firmware update is finished, check if the device connects properly.\r\nNext, open the Vibration Test interface to test the vibration function, making sure to select the correct motor type.\r\nWe also recommend updating the telemetry data to ensure everything works correctly.\r\n\r\n[https://attachment.freshdesk.com/inline/attachment?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MTU4MDAyMTUyNjA5LCJkb21haW4iOiJzaW1zb25uLmZyZXNoZGVzay5jb20iLCJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjo0MjA2MDM2fQ.hm1xO01OvRnxVhC_7jkkA6SuWY2Z8HhmKP2pePtf5a4]\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdSWa1bxmbPksj9Hlzuo8bl7_bM8ixr/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 25 Sep at 3:55 AM , Simen Asphaug <simenasphaug@hotmail.com> wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nI’m located in Oslo, Norway (CET time zone).\r\nMy availability is as follows:\r\n\r\n  *\r\nThursday–Sunday: 16:00–21:00 CET (also 09:00–16:00 CET if it doesn’t conflict with work meetings)\r\n  *\r\nMonday–Wednesday: 18:00–21:00 CET\r\n\r\n//Simen\r\n________________________________\r\nFra: service@simsonn.com <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSendt: onsdag 24. september 2025 17:43\r\nTil: simenasphaug@hotmail.com <simenasphaug@hotmail.com>\r\nEmne: Re: Issue with VAM Pro Vibration Motors – Prolonged/Stuck Vibrations\r\n\r\nHi Simen Asphaug,\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your city and local time, as well as when you are available.
