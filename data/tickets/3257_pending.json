  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well!\r\n\r\nAs agreed, I’m happy to share that my community has already generated more\r\nthan *$1,350 in sales* through my affiliate code and link – which is well\r\nabove the 5 confirmed orders we discussed as the requirement for a\r\ncommunity giveaway.\r\n\r\nI would therefore love to move forward with the *giveaway of a Simsonn\r\nPedals Plus X set* during my next Le Mans Ultimate community event on\r\n*September\r\n5–6 (the 6h COTA event)*. This would be a fantastic opportunity to reward\r\nmy audience, create excitement around Simsonn, and further establish your\r\nbrand here in Germany. Could you please let me know if it’s possible to\r\narrange the giveaway in time for this event?\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have already published *two YouTube videos* featuring the\r\nSimsonn Pedals:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Review :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfFx_shqNUs\r\n   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQffPFMOSs&utm_source=chatgpt.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Unboxing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQffPFMOSs\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I believe we now have a great foundation to explore a *closer\r\npartnership*. Some ideas I’d love to discuss include:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Regular *giveaway collaborations* for future community events.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Featuring Simsonn as an *official stream sponsor* with logo placement,\r\n   banners, and shoutouts during live streams.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Potential *early access to new products* for reviews and unboxings,\r\n   which I can then promote directly to my growing community.\r\n\r\nThe feedback from my viewers has been very positive, and I’m confident that\r\nwith a stronger partnership we can significantly increase Simsonn’s\r\nvisibility in the German sim racing market.\r\n\r\nI’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and to continuing this\r\nexciting journey together!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPierre (Chuxl90_)\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Dear Pierre,  Thank you very much for your message and for the recognition and support you’ve given us. We’re delighted to hear that your community has already generated over $1,350 in sales through your affiliate code — that’s fantastic news and a strong testament to your dedication and influence.  We’re also very excited about your idea to give away a Simsonn Pedals Plus X set during your upcoming Le Mans Ultimate community event on September 5–6.

We just need to confirm with you whether you would like us to ship the prize to you in advance, or if you prefer that we ship it directly to the winner after the event.
