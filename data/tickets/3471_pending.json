  "description_text": "I am writing about the warranty for my pedals, the Simsonn plus x P3-H3.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I don't really enjoy brake feel during casual, non-racing use.\r\n\r\nI am considering a modification to improve the feel to my liking,\r\nspecifically regarding the spare clutch springs. I believe they would fit\r\nperfectly with either a 28mm rubber damper or by using the spring alone\r\n.\r\nBefore proceeding, I would like to confirm if this modification would void\r\nthe warranty on the pedals themselves. My primary concern is maintaining\r\nthe warranty for the main pedal set; the warranty on the accessories is a\r\nlower priority for me.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise if making this change is permissible under the\r\nterms of the warranty?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance.\r\n\r\n",
