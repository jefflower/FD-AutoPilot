  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI purchased the Simsonn pro X ultras as well as a VAM pro linear haptic for the brake pedal. I am receiving an issue with intermittent feedback or sometimes continued feedback with no input. I have tired both the simsoon software as well as simhub. I’ve added the nylon washers between the pedal and haptic. I’m not sure what else to do. I did have an issue with the haptics not showing power initially even though they were plugged in properly. I figured it could be an issue with the control box?  Eventually after unplugging and plugging in the pedals a couple times they seemed to work.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Michael Allen,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

This did not help, when racing this time the VAM PRO totally lost connection and kept shaking until I unplugged the power supply from the control box. My contol box seems to have a somewhat loose connection for the power supply input, could the control box be the issue? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n> ",

If all three are connected securely, signal interruptions should not occur. Additionally, please try securing the VAM Pro power cable with cable ties and see if that helps. ",
