  "description_text": "Dear Service team!\r\nI’m about to purchase a haptic motor but I have a few questions.\r\n1. I have a Moza SR-P pedal, can I mount it to it? And does the mounting\r\nthat you provide is enough?\r\n2. What do I need to order, because I’m a bit lost honestly. Currently I\r\ndon’t have any haptic motors or anything, so no power supply and etc. What\r\nkit do I need to order? I want it to cover every need, the power, the\r\ncontrol, mounting, and the motors or anything that needed.\r\nThank you for your help!\r\nBest regards,\r\nBenedek Kovacs\r\n\r\n",
