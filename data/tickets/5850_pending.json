  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI’m interested in ordering the Plus X P3-H3 and the VAM Pro 2-Pack. I only plan to use the haptics on the acceleration and brake pedals.\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm if the VAM Pro 2-Pack comes with the correct mounting brackets for the acceleration and brake pedals, or if one of the included brackets is meant for the clutch instead? Cause this is what I've seen in the pictures, please do let me know if I'll need to add another bracket separately!\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nCosmin\r\n\r\n",
