      "body_text": "Hi Luuk4100, To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
