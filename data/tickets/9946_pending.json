  "description_text": "My name is Nate, and I represent Savage Sim Racing (SSR), a sim-racing\r\norganization with a community of nearly 600 active drivers.\r\n\r\nSSR operates endurance teams, leagues, and a structured development program\r\nfocused on helping newer drivers learn racecraft, preparation, and\r\nconsistency in a positive, team-first environment. A large portion of our\r\nmembers are actively investing in sim-racing hardware, software, and\r\ncoaching as they progress.\r\n\r\nWe’re exploring potential affiliate partnerships and discount programs that\r\nwe could offer directly to our members. In return, we actively recommend\r\nand direct drivers toward products we believe add real value to their\r\ndevelopment and racing experience.\r\n\r\nIf this is something you’d be open to discussing, we’d be happy to share\r\nmore about our community and explore a mutually beneficial partnership.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nNathaniel Halastik\r\nFounder – Savage Sim Racing\r\n\r\n",
