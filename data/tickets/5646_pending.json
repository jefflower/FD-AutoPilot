      "body_text": "Hi Rasmus Holm,  Have you downloaded the SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 software? If the interface shows “Version too old, not supported,” please go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, please be sure to recalibrate the pedals, as they will not function properly in games without calibration.      https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
