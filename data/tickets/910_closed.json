  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just received my pedal set and I’m having an issue with the throttle\r\npedal. It worked fine for about an hour, but then it stopped functioning\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nNow the throttle doesn’t register any input until the pedal is pressed\r\nabout 30–40%. I noticed that the small gray spring at the base of the\r\npedal, which presses on the load cell to provide initial pressure, has\r\nbroken. Please see the attached pictures.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can’t locate the broken plastic piece that holds\r\nthe spring down anymore.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to send me a replacement throttle pedal? The pedal is\r\ncurrently completely unusable.\r\n\r\nI’ve already sent you a message through Amazon, but I’m also contacting you\r\nhere to share the pictures.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\n",
