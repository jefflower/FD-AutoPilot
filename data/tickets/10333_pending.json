It has been a while from\r\nthe last time we talked about our professional collaboration, I just wanted\r\nyou to ensure cooperation with us in posting the announcement of our\r\npartnership and the introduction of the Simsonn Award on Instagram.\r\n\r\nAlso remember that we need to have access to the raw assets of the Plus X\r\nand Pro X Ultra as videos and pictures if you want to have a proper\r\nspotlight during the promotion of your brand in the championship, so\r\nplease, provide us with any material you want us to include in the\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nWe pretend to begin the campaign the next week, so we´ll be grateful with\r\nyour agility.\r\n\r\nThanks for attending; we´re looking forward to your answer.\r\nSanti Concepción, Cumbre Sim Racing´s CEO.\r\n\r\n",
