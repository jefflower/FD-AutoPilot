Additionally, make sure to plug the USB cable into a rear USB 3.0 blue port on your computer and avoid using USB hubs. Many USB hubs are of poor quality, which can lead to insufficient power supply or data transmission issues. If the motor continues to run even after being stopped, it usually indicates that the stop command was not properly received. In our own testing environment and with other customers, we have not encountered this issue. ",
