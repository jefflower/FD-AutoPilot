  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nMy name is *Santi Concepción*, and I am contacting you on behalf of *Cumbre\r\nSimRacing*. We are pleased to introduce the *Cumbre SimRacing GT World\r\nChampionship 2026*, a global GT series featuring *€15,000 in prizes\r\ndistributed among the top 20 drivers*, across *six rounds throughout 2026*.\r\nBased on current projections, we expect *over 600 drivers* to take part,\r\nmaking it one of the most competitive and widely followed sim racing\r\nchampionships of the year.\r\n\r\nWe would be delighted to count Simsonn as one of our official partners. As\r\npart of our proposal, your brand logo would appear on *every car competing\r\nin the championship*, ensuring consistent visibility throughout the season.\r\nIn addition, each race broadcast would begin with a *15-second Simsonn\r\nproduct spotlight*, and our full social-media campaign would include *tags\r\nand mentions* of your brand in all championship-related posts. We would\r\nalso introduce a special prize—the *Simsonn Award*—granted to the driver\r\nachieving the most pole positions during the season.\r\n\r\nIn return for these assets, we kindly request your support in the form\r\nof *shared\r\npromotion*: reposting social-media activity related to the championship,\r\nthe Simsonn Award, and selected action photos or videos that we will\r\nprovide throughout the competition. This shared visibility will strengthen\r\nthe impact of both brands and maximise engagement with our respective\r\naudiences.\r\n\r\nFinally, we would like to request a *30% discount* on two of your products:\r\nthe *Simsonn Pedals Plus X*, awarded to the winner of the Simsonn Award;\r\nand the *Simsonn Pedals Pro X Ultra*, awarded to the overall champion of\r\nthe GT World Championship. Cumbre SimRacing will cover the discounted\r\npurchase cost so that both winners receive their prizes *free of charge*.\r\n\r\nWe would be glad to discuss any details further and explore how we can\r\nbuild a strong collaboration for 2026. Thank you very much for your time\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n*Cumbre SimRacing*\r\n\r\n",
