On the software interface, click the Restore button first, then click Save to see if the issue can be resolved. I also need you to provide some videos clearly showing the problem. It’s recommended to upload the complete video as an attachment before sending the email to us. Once we analyze the details, we will help you resolve the issue as soon as possible.      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPkeOHREyALtCtNmL87a2WnUDZV0Gx_b/view?usp=drive_link",

All works fine when I plug it back in with or without the pedals plugged in, iracing I can not calibrate with in iracing, unless I unplug the box, I downloaded huskavelt controller app and it pics up the random glitch on x and y axis. I have had trouble with this same box before, and you sent me a new one however it is either un programmed or it bad as well, Simsonn tool shows its reconnected, when I push the upgrade button it shows that’s active however on the pc side it shows driver error and I have no way of finding a driver or a way to update the box. The box I am using the brake pedal socket does not work I have had to use the clutch socket since I received the pedals. I have really had many problems with pedals the hydraulic damper on the throttle pedal locked up, and had to remove it, the rod that hold the elastomer for the brakes fell out even though there was a lock nut in place, causing it to fail during a race event and ruining the threads, I was able to repair. I do want to thank you for your fast response, I have let everyone in my leagues know what has happened and the fast response I have received, they are all interested it what happens, I race with a little over 200 people between all the leagues I’m part of, when the pedals do work they are nice I wish I could change the elastomers but with the rod damage, I have to remove the whole unit to change them..my question to you is can I purchase a new box from Amazon will it come programmed for plug and plug, or ready to update, although all of this started a few days later after update but I hoping to try a new box, other wise I will try and see if I can return with a RMA for a refund. And find a replacement set somewhere else I have not had these long I’m sending a copy of when purchased. April 9th 2025 Again thanks for all the support and help. Sent from my iPhone",
