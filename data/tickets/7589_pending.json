  "description_text": "Simsonn Team\r\n\r\nMy name is Reece, though I go by DeadEndReece across my platforms.\r\n\r\nI’m an up-and-coming content creator focused entirely on sim racing and\r\nsim-driving content.\r\n\r\nI stream daily on Twitch, where I currently average between 10–30 viewers\r\nper stream, I also run a growing Discord community dedicated to sim\r\ndrivers, many of whom are actively looking to upgrade their equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m reaching out because I’m extremely interested in your products,\r\nespecially as my current setup is nearing the end of its lifespan.\r\n\r\nI’ve been following your development closely, including the wheelbase,\r\nwhich I’m very excited to see once it’s ready.\r\n\r\nI would love to explore the possibility of a sponsorship or partnership\r\nwith Simsonn, whether that includes a discount code, product reviews, or\r\nany collaboration you feel would be mutually beneficial.\r\n\r\nI believe your equipment would be a perfect fit for my content and my\r\ncommunity, and I would be thrilled to showcase your products to my audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and I’d be happy to provide any additional\r\ninformation you may need.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the possibility of working together.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nReece\r\n\r\nDeadEndReece\r\n\r\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/deadendreece\r\n\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/WDeb9fxuhq\r\n\r\n",
