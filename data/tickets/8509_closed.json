  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n     I'm writing to know the status of order SSN4820. From the tracking \r\npage it's still to be collected by UPS. I chose the Express Delivery, \r\nI'd like to know the shipping date, since it's a Xmas gift and I really \r\nreally need to receive it before that date. I thought the delivery was \r\nfrom England, but looks like it's from China and this makes me a bit \r\nworried.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nMichele\r\n",
