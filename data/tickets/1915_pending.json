  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm writing to reply to the Amazon message. (Note the account is under\r\nEllen Scott, my wife)\r\n\r\nAs requested, attached please find some images of the broken part. Note\r\nthat I removed the pedal travel limiter _only_ to take pictures and to try\r\nto insert the spring back.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in my Amazon response, I noticed a click on the throttle a day\r\nor two ago, and a weird dead zone. I tried to adjust the pedal travel, and\r\nthen the spring flied out and noticed the broken part.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need a video still.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nChristian A. Rivera, Esq\r\n\r\n",
