  "description_text": "Hello, when will the VAM Pro Haptics be available on AliExpress?\n\nAlso, I got the Simsonn Plus X in anticipation of the VAM Pro.\n\nI am currently using Simruito pedals. In Assetto Corsa, etc., the pedal input is recognized.\nBut the Simsonn Manager shows 0 input, so I can't calibrate my pedals.\n\nCan you please sell spare Plus X loadcell sensors (throttle, clutch, brake)?\nI have read from multiple people that Simjack pedals work fine, but aren't they the same?",

After properly connecting the pedals, unplug and reconnect the USB cable. Then click the \"Offset\" button in the software to perform a factory reset. This should resolve the issue you’re experiencing.",
