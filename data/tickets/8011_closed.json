  "description_text": " \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nHello,\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nI placed an order for PRO X U-P3-H3-1-1 (Pro X Ultra with Baseplate) and it was \"delivered\" through UPS tracking #1ZJ201H40303678364. However, I only received a slim brown box containing the Baseplate, heel plate and LED strip (no pedal hardware). I checked with Amazon and they said to get in touch with UPS. I called UPS and they told me that the item is correctly delivered and that there was only 1 box in the shipment. Their recommendation was to check with the shipper so I am writing today to see if I can still expect the pedals or if I should place another order and seek a refund from Amazon? Please advise, thank you!\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nOrder summary\r\n \r\nOrder placed\r\n \r\nDecember 3, 2025\r\n \r\nOrder #\r\n \r\n113-7566553-5041835\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nUPS Tracking\r\n \r\n1ZJ201H40303678364\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nBest regards,\r\n \r\nJose Pacheco\r\n \r\njosepacheco400@gmail.com\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n",
