  "description_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nI am having issues getting my VAM pro's working in Simhub. It looks like it may be a usb issue however I have tried with 2 brand new USB A to USB B cable. With one it was registering in simhub but it was dropping out very often. With another USB cable (a better one) it does not register at all.\r\n\r\nThe USB drivers are all up to date\r\n\r\nSee below details and screenshots.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n[cid:e757f61b-0c40-48b4-9399-aa81087d77b9]\r\n[cid:9df0f12d-08f8-4a38-b7bf-6308229bcb26]\r\n[cid:131b199c-1b30-4852-b4ec-f5da756c922f]\r\n\r\n",

Also, are you using SIMHUB version 9.9.3? With SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0, there should be no issues. If it is indeed version 9.9.3, please provide me with the SimHub logo file. ",
