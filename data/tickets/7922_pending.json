The older Simsonn Pro pedal is typically compatible only with the PlusX controller and may not work with the ProX Ultra controller box.  If the ProX Ultra controller cannot detect the motor, please try manually updating the firmware. Additionally, we recommend using a USB 3.0 (blue) port and avoiding USB hubs when connecting the device.         Please follow the steps below to start the firmware update process:    Press the upgrade button on the controller box;    Reconnect the USB cable;    Wait for the software to indicate that it has entered “Simsonn Flasher Mode”;    Go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-proxultra.sfu to start updating the firmware;    After the update is completed, release the upgrade button;    Finally, test and recalibrate the pedals.",

      "body_text": "Hi mike h,    First, please ensure you are using SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2. Also, connect only one SIMSONN control box at a time—do not connect multiple units simultaneously.    For Pro series control boxes: If the version is 1.7.1, you can update the firmware via: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-plus.sfu (This method does not apply to 1.7.0 control boxes.)    For PlusX pedals: Only the plusx.sfu firmware can be used for updates.     If you are using the PlusX pedal, please refer to the recommendations below:    VAM Pro Interference Issue To prevent the VAM Pro motor from interfering with the brake signal, you can install nylon washers and nylon screws on the VAM Pro motor.    Vibration Not Stopping / Disconnection Caused by Poor Grounding If the pedal keeps vibrating or disconnects unexpectedly, it is usually due to poor grounding of the PC, often caused by not using a three-prong plug or an outlet without proper grounding. We recommend following the solutions mentioned in the posts:    Connect the PC case to the rig frame with a metal connection.    Connect the main control box to the pedal’s metal screws for proper grounding. These steps can effectively resolve issues such as continuous vibration, signal interference, and random disconnections.       https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
