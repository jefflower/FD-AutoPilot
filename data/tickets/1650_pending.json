  "description_text": "Hey Simsonn, I had ordered some Pedals through your website, but when they were ordered, I did not have an account. I entered in this email, \"mseanleech@vt.edu\" but never got a order confirmation. I don't know if it was a typo or a problem on your side. I later created an account with the said email and received the account t confirmation code emails just fine. I do have the bank statements saying the order went through, I ordered it July 14th with express shipping and would just like to track the package! Is there any way I can do that? ",
