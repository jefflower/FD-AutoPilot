We have urgently arranged air freight and expect shipment on the 22nd, with an estimated delivery date around the 25th.  2. The power supply was delayed for two weeks due to a product upgrade. The upgrade is now complete, and the power supply shipped on the 14th.  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Should you have any questions, we will prioritize addressing them for you.",
