  "description_text": "This review was automatically published.Learn more A review was edited for Simsonn Plus X Racing Simulator Pedal with Baseplate from Perry Bird perrygeebee@gmail.com ✅ Updated review Perry Bird Display name: Perry B. Good value for money but it flexes under pressure. The plate feels heavy and well made. No sharp edges. The item was packed well. Only issue is that it flexes with heavy braking. I have purchased aluminium trunking to fix underneath to stop the flexing. This should solve the problem at a low cost. The plate is fixed in 4 places on a Si Turnbull rig.\r\n\r\nI would still recommend this plate. I will also update this review if possible once the modifications have been done. \r\n\r\nI was not using the Simsonn pedals. I was using a heavier pedal set. Edit reason More detail added.
