  "description_text": "hi, I received the pedals purchased on aliexpress. after testing them other\r\nthan the brake being too stiff, I had another problem. When i press brake\r\nand stay to a certain percentage it floats around that value. For example\r\nif I press to 80% brake it will float between 75 and 85% even if I don't\r\nchange the force I'm using, how do I solve this issue? Clutch and Throttle\r\nhave no issues. I will attach you a screen record of the issue.\r\n\r\n",
