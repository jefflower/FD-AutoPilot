      "body_text": "Hi Finn Von Schmedling,  Please provide your pedal order number, and then update the firmware again. The manual firmware update procedures are as follows for your reference, and please also refer to the grounding method to ensure proper device operation.      Launch the latest version of SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2.   On the “Plus X” control unit, press and hold the “Upgrade” button. While holding the button, unplug the USB cable from the PC and then plug it back in. The software should detect the device entering “SIMSONN Flasher update mode”. In the software go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update. In the file selector choose: pedals‑firmware → pedals‑plusx.sfu. Click “Start Update” and wait until the firmware is completely written. During this process do not disconnect the USB or close the application. Once the update is finished (you’ll get a success prompt or the unit will reboot), unplug and re‑plug the USB then test the pedal device to confirm everything works correctly.      ProX / ProX Ultra Pedal Firmware Update Procedure:    Press and hold the Upgrade button on the control box;    Reconnect the USB cable;    The software will indicate that the device has entered “Simsonn Flasher mode”;    In the software, go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-proxultra.sfu (If it’s a ProX pedal, select pedals-prox.sfu)    Start the firmware update, and once it is complete, release the Upgrade button;    Finally, retest and calibrate the pedals.    If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding           ​",
