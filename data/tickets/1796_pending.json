  "description_text": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI am reaching out regarding my throttle simsonn pro x ultra pedal which\r\nseems to be faulty, it is recognized by the Simsonn software (which has\r\nbeen updated) but does not detect any pedal input. I checked to see if it\r\nwas an EMI issue, it is not. I also disconnected everything and reconnected\r\nit, still doesn’t work. Finally, I swapped the connection of the throttle\r\nand clutch to the box to see if the box was the issue, but when I connect\r\nmy throttle to the clutch, the clutch’s input is not recognized. Likewise,\r\nwith the clutch connected tit the throttle position, the clutch is\r\nrecognized as a throttle. I want to see what we can do to resolve this, can\r\nI be sent a replacement throttle pedal? These pedals are less than a month\r\nold, and they have not gotten much use.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLuis D Prieto\r\n\r\n",
