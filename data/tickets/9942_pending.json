      "body_text": "Hi Zaher Bizri,     Please first uninstall SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 from your PC, then download and install the latest version from our official website. After installation, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu and complete the firmware update.  After updating:    If the white signal is not at 0%, click the Offset button to reset the white raw signal to 0%;    Then recalibrate the pedals;    Once calibration is complete, the blue signal should move smoothly from 0% to 100%;    Next, calibrate the pedals in-game and set the minimum and maximum dead zones if needed;    Finally, bind the pedals in the game.    If the issue still persists, please record a video and share it with us via Google Drive, making sure the link access is set to viewable. I will review it and provide you with a solution.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
