Thanks!\r\n\r\n No I have integrared them into my simrig and I have a problem.\r\n\r\nI calibrated them and check them on the simsonn software and seems ok, but\r\nwindows does not get any data from the axis. I mean, windows recognices the\r\ndevice, knows that has 3 axis but no input is gathered. I think, because of\r\nthis, muy simulators (LMU mainly) cant recognize the pedals, I cant assigt\r\nthe controls, so right now it is unusable.\r\n\r\nI attach a video hoping it will help with my description. Also it can be\r\nseen that sometimes a value is not registered but that could be a software\r\nbug, i do not know. Also, the ground wire is not installed yet, I do not\r\nhave the suitable allen key.\r\n\r\nAlso, in another theme, due to the delays in shipping, in one of my\r\ntickets, it said that the shipping cost will be refunded. I do not know how\r\nthat process goes or if I missundestud this. I can reply to that specific\r\nmessage if it is necessary.\r\n\r\nI hope we can fix this, and thank you for your support.\r\nIgnacio.\r\n\r\nEl mié, 31 dic 2025, 10:40, service@simsonn.com \nAttachment(s) that exceed the 20 MB limit have been dropped.
