  "description_text": "\r\nHello Simsonn,\r\n\r\n I just receiving my order (#SSN2873) this morning. Unfortunately though when I went through the box I did not find the Haptic Motors or their mounting hardware? I did not see any info about them shipping separately so I thought I should reach out and double check with you. I took a quick picture of what I received if that helps at all.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is any info you need from me. I am excited to get these setup and to try then with active feedback!\r\n\r\nThank you, Payton G.\r\n\r\n",

I started to get my pedals setup and mounted however and unfortunately discovered I had an extra wire coming from underneath the brake pedal that Im not supposed to have I dont think.\r\n\r\nIts a small 3 pin connector on the bottom side of the brake pedal that I assumed was probably just RGB or something that plugged into the main power module. After realizing it does not go to the main control unit I started looking around and realized it has come unsoldered from the bottom of the brake pedal. I figured I should reach out before going any further. Ill attach some photos of the plug and where it came unsoldered from so you guys can see what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",
