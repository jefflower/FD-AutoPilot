  "description_text": "Hi Team Simsonn,\r\n\r\nI hope you're well.\r\n\r\nMy name is Josh/STR33TRAC3R, and I’m a Sim Racing content creator and streamer. I'm currently using Moza SRP Lite pedals, but I feel I’ve reached their performance limit and am now looking to upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter researching various options, I believe the Simsonn Plus X P3-H3 Pedals with the baseplate in black would be the perfect next step in my sim racing journey.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I wanted to reach out to explore the possibility of a sponsorship or a larger discount on this set. In return, I’d be happy to create and share detailed promotional content including unboxing, setup, customization, and live feedback during my streams.\r\n\r\nI’m also racing in the upcoming 24 Hours of Barcelona Sim Race on October 18th, and would love the opportunity to showcase the Plus X pedals during this endurance event.\r\n\r\nTo gauge interest, I posted a TikTok about these pedals and it received 373 views within the first few hours:\r\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@str33trac3r/photo/7551042986319138070\r\n\r\nI’d love to discuss a potential partnership further if this is something your team is open to.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n?
