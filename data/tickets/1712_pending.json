  "description_text": "Hi.\r\n\r\nI am able to calibrate my pedals in the simsonn manager, however when I go\r\ninto games to assign the pedals there is an extra channel. This extra\r\nchannel is axis 4 in some games or x rotation in control panel. This\r\nchannel is flickering and makes it impossible to assign the pedals in game\r\nor even get into some games. I have attached a picture  and clip of said\r\nproblem. I am willing to trouble shoot this to get these working properly.\r\nHowever if this can't be resolved I will need to return them.\r\n\r\nAwaiting your response.\r\n\r\nKind regards.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n",
