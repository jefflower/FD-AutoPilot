  "description_text": "Good evening, I bought your pedals back earlier this year, and I've loved\r\nthem so far. But lately I've been having issues with the brake pedal being\r\nall the way up to 100%. I've tried restarting my pc, the app, I've updated\r\nthe software, and everything. The pedal doesn't even respond a little bit.\r\nI'm thinking it's the load cell and the wire that connects to the pedal\r\nhub. I am wondering what I can do that would fix it, and if I have to get a\r\nnew 200kg Load Cell I will, if that is possible to get just the load cell\r\nitself instead of a whole new pedal set. The order number that the set is\r\nunder is #SSN1576. If you guys need any other information please let me\r\nknow.\r\nThank you, have a great day.\r\n\r\n",
