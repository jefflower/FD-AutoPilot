      "body_text": "Hi Bart Caethoven, In our test environment, F1 2025 runs without any issues. Because the RX axis on our previous handbrake was not disabled, it may cause F1 2025 to fail to bind correctly. You can try fixing this issue using SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1: Open the SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1 software. In the interface, click the “Restore” button. Then click the “Save” button. Reinsert the USB cable. Finally, test to confirm if the RX axis has been successfully disabled. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
