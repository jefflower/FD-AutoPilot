  "description_text": "To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nI received order #SSN2568 on September 15th. I've had the pedals mounted to\r\na rig, and for the past week I have not been able to calibrate the pedals\r\nto iRacing. Even without a wheel base setup, the calibration bar on iRacing\r\nis all over the place. These pedals worked fine for about a week, now they\r\nwon't barely even work on F1 25. If possible I'd like to return the pedals\r\nand receive a refund please. I was really looking forward to these pedals,\r\nbut I've had nothing but bad luck with them. I apologize for the\r\ninconvenience in this matter. I hope we can get this resolved as soon as\r\npossible. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKevin Pawlaczyk\r\n\r\n",
