  "description_text": "Hi, just saw your new shifter and I really like it. My main concern is how loud it is and how much metal on metal contact there is? For example Fanatec shifter is really loud and that metal klang is just too much. But TM TH8a with tpu inserts for the gears and tpu sleeve was perfectly fine and not that loud :) also have you thought making it compatible with Fanatec so it could be used on PS and GT7?\r\n\r\nThx!\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",

We have added nylon strips under the gear positions, and the gear cover is made of carbon fiber, so you don’t need to worry about noise from metal-on-metal contact.  At the moment, we do not support Fanatec, so it is not compatible with PS4 or PS5 yet. We will study this possibility in the future.",
