  "description_text": "This order from 5 months ago, seems to be defective. The motors to the\r\nsimpson plux x motor module seems to have gone bad on two of the 3 modules.\r\nI can swap the remaining motor to any of the three motor controls on\r\nthe control box so I don't think it's the control box. Any chance I can get\r\na discount on two motor modules only. I don't need the full kit.\r\n\r\nNate\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jul 16, 2025 at 10:26 AM Nathan Brown <nathanpbrown78@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> I have an amazon order:containin haptic pedal motors and a control box.
