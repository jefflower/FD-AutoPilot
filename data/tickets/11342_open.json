  "description_text": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nYesterday finally I tried to test the pedals! But unfortunately the\r\ncomputer don't recognise it as a control... In the app everything works\r\nwell, but I can't use it on games because on the game controller menu it\r\ndoesn't give me the 3 axes... On Assetto Corsa I can't introduce the\r\npedals, it doesn't read.\r\nCan you please help me?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nFrancisco\r\n\r\n",
