Im a woman and I dont really have much strenght but I\r\nalso want to feel the brakes.\r\nFor reference Im now using the Moza SR-P Lite and with the brake kit Its\r\ntoo stiff for me, and without it its soft and I have no feeling.\r\nI just want to make sure I will be able to set it to fit me before purchase.\r\n\r\nBest regards :)\r\n\r\n",

Alternatively, you can purchase a set of white 30HA soft elastomer pads to increase your available brake pedal travel.  https://www.simsonn.com/products/elastomer",
