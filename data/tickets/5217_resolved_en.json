In addition, please ensure your VAM device is set to VAM mode. Using the incompatible VAM Pro mode may cause the motor to fail within a short period of time. Although our design includes compatibility protection, we still recommend strictly using the correct mode.  Also, please confirm whether your firmware version shows CPU1: 2.0.5 and CPU2: 2.0.4, so I can verify that you are using the latest firmware version.",
