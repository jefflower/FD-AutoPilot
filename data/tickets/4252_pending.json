  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have recently ordered a product from your page in the form of a steering\r\nwheel and decided that to go with the Express 3-7 days shipping as I was in\r\na rush to get it. However, unfortunately more then 7 days have passed since\r\nI placed my order and my order has not even gotten in my country of\r\ndelivery. Because of this I would like to ask for compensation due to the\r\nfact that the mentioned delivery time frame was not meet.\r\n\r\nI have waited not only 7 days as of today 30th of September in my time zone\r\nof the Uk. But also allocated enough time in the form of 7 BUSINESS days\r\n(Monday to Friday) but also with the 1-2 days manufacturing  delay.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon and be able to come up with a suitable agreement\r\nfor the inconvenience I have experienced.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex Ancuta\r\n\r\n",
