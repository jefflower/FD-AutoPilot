  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Adrien, and I am a delighted customer of your exceptional pedal system, especially impressed by the haptic motors integrated into the design. The craftsmanship and performance have truly exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\nI am in the process of customizing my cockpit to better suit my needs, and I am reaching out to request the 3D model or plans for your pedal box support plate. Unfortunately, the current plate is too large to fit my cockpit. Having access to this model would greatly assist me in designing a custom support plate that fits perfectly within my setup. If you prefer to adjust the plate to fit my cockpit, I would be equally thrilled.\r\n\r\nYour assistance in this matter would be incredibly valuable, and I would be very grateful for your support. If there are any specific requirements or steps I need to follow to obtain this model, please do let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nAdrien Lugnot\r\n? 0695204443\r\n✉️ adrien082002@hotmail.fr\r\n\r\n\r\n",
