Sometimes during calibration, it detects the seventh gear position as reverse, while other times it detects neutral as reverse. It's unusable this way. Is there a way to fix it?",

During calibration, shift through the gears in the following order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → R. Once calibration is completed successfully, the device will work properly and switch modes normally.",
