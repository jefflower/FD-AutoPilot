  "description_text": "Hi again, just wondering about the weight of the carbon fiber wheel hub: Simsonn Steering Wheel Hub S1 – Professional Precision and Durability – SIMSONN<https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-racing-simulator-carbon-fiber-and-aluminum-steering-wheel-hub?variant=50445829079354>\r\nIt says 2.4 kg on your website. That's extremely heavy for a wheel hub. Does this include the weight of the steering wheel as well, maybe?\r\n\r\nOn AliExpress however, it says 593 grams. So is that the weight of only the wheel hub (without the steering wheel)?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTrygve\r\n\r\n",
