The extra features of the Pro X won't be used.The control box for the Pro X Ultra wasn't supposed to be sold separately, so we didn't design a packaging solution for it and it will have to be shipped separately. We will refund you the difference and send you the control box for the Plus X. Thank you for your understanding. Also, I noticed that you ordered two sets of VAM Pro, please confirm.",
