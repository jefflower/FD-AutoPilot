  "description_text": "This is now my second email and you can ignore my first one. I have a brand new plus X2 pedal set with the base plate and heightening plate. The clutch pedal is in transit. While assembling this pedal set, the RJ 11 cable or whatever the small cable is was not connected to the small clip that goes into the control box. It is a bare wire and does not operate. I need to understand what my return options are to Amazon, that order number is:#114-2563076-8315440 I am well within my return window, but would prefer to have this replaced under warranty as I understand this is supposed to be a very good pedal set. Please confirm my options for me for either return, exchange or replacement. I’m attaching a picture of the pedal which also has a small spring that has come out and I do not know where it was. Thank you for your time and you can either return this email or call my cell number at 732-319-2835.

      "body_text": "Hi Gary Lederman, Hello, this spring should be installed at the position indicated by the arrow. Insert it and press it into place with your finger. I’ve attached a reference image. The RJ connector can be taken to a local computer repair shop to re-crimp according to the brake wiring. If you can’t find a shop, we can also send you a replacement sensor assembly with the connector pre-attached for free, which you can manually install.",

      "body_text": "Thank you so much for the reply, Unfortunately, we had to return the set to Amazon. Their Customer rep on chat, told me I had to return them in order to receive a refund to purchase the other sets we need. I have them labeled & taped securely for return to you and as you'll see, we have purchased additional sets from a combo of your store & Amazon. It was a bit confusing choosing certain sets. The sites have the wrong description when you click the radio button to change to another choice & has options that are Simsonn AND Simsonn Official. We bought the sets we need. Please see the last email for more detail, which I will also include copy below.

      "body_text": "Hello again, I am writing to once again thank you for the careful & professional support & reply. I must admit that I reacted quickly because I was spooked & concerned by the comments made in the Amazon reviews about your company’s service. Several people stated that “customer service does not exist “ and that they had “terrible experience” and I should save my money & buy something from a different company. This set never made it to use due to the issues you addressed. I have found many times that people who have a negative experience for one reason or another, tend to complain, more than someone who is satisfied. We live & operate our Sim arcade in a very small town in the mountains of North Eastern Georgia & do not have access to any electronic repair shops for the type of repair you presented, so a return & repurchase was our only option. WELL, all of that is simply not true. You answered my immediate concerns with very detailed & descriptive explanations & were very polite. Therefore, I will continue to buy your products & will be crafting a few VERY GOOD 5 star ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ reviews for not just Amazon, but on your site & across the board, in Trust Pilot & the internet as a whole. Please consider us as unofficial “Brand Ambassadors”. We will be hiring someone for onsite repairs in the spring, Even though our town is small, we have many people who rely on us for Simulator cockpits & peripherals. We have the ability to refer many people to you for purchases. Please indicate whether you’d prefer us to point these buyers to your site directly? Or to Amazon & other online outlets? I’ve noticed that the prices on your site are higher in most cases than Amazon for the same products. Our reputation is important & we don’t want our customers to find the prices lower somewhere else. Thank you for your time & let us know if you’d like to display or provide “models” to show our customers.

They have been wonderful to work with and have addressed every concern I had professionally and promptly.
