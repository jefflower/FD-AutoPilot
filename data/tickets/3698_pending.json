  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIm folowing up on our conversation through amazon for order number:\r\n 701-7115180-5540227.\r\n\r\nTo re-iterate the problem, i have simsonn plus x pedals and I just got the\r\nvan pro-s. The issue that I’m having is that when the vibration is\r\nhappening I get the brake loadcell to react and detect brake pressure while\r\nI’m not touching the brakes. I have done testing to see if this is an EMI\r\nissue and it doesn’t seem to be but maybe a loadcell issue? I have tested\r\nthe resistance of the different components with a multimeter and I don’t\r\nsee any resistance. Also I have grounded the control box to the brake or\r\nthe throttle pedal with no results since I don’t think it’s an EMI issue.\r\n\r\nHere is a video showing the problem:\r\nhttps://we.tl/t-m8Z6d9evKJ\r\n\r\nI’m also attaching a few pictures to show the setup.\r\n\r\nThe power is grounded with the 3 prong connection, everything else is\r\ngrounded, I’m plugging the usb directly to the usb3.1 port on the computer,\r\nno hubs, software is latest 2.1 i believe, and I isolated the vams from the\r\nbracket with the red washers. So I followed all the instructions from our\r\nconversation on Amazon. Please let me know what the issue is.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",
