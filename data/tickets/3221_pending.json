Which of the 8 effects listed ( including speed,\r\nclutch, tyre slip, RPM, ABS, gear shift, traction control (TC), and tyre\r\nlock) are supported in iRacing. And i they are not supported by the Simsonn\r\nManager are all of them supported using SimHub in iRacing?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Aug 29, 2025 at 2:25 AM support@simsonn.com ",
