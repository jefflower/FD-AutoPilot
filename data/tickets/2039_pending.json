  "description_text": "\r\nHello,\r\nI'm asking about a case I raised on the Amazon support to simsonn but I couldn't send the files to show what was the problem. The hydraulic damper on the accelerator pedal on my plus x pedals seems to not be 1way or is a faulty 1way despite being labelled that way. Here is a video of the spring, I took the normal spring off to demonstrate how it doesn't bounce back on its own, you can't actually see my hand letting go but when I push it forward I let go and it doesn't come back.\r\nSent from Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Cayden Hague,   Single-direction damping means there is resistance when pressing the pedal, but no resistance when it returns. Dual-direction damping means there is resistance in both directions — during pressing and returning.      Additionally, the video you uploaded is incomplete and cannot be opened properly. Please consider using Google Drive to upload the video and share the link with us. ",
