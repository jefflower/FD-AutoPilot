It has lights that give feedback based on game telemetry data, and a much nicer light and shape. If you don't need these features, the Plus X pedals will be better value for money as they have the same elastomers and hydraulics. Both pedals are suitable for F1 and LMP, and are compatible with our haptic system. The specific choice depends on your preferences.",

      "body_text": "Hi stef willems,  Yes, the throttle only requires one screw for fixation. For the brake’s VAM Pro, we recommend using nylon screws and washers to eliminate interference with the brake signal. You may also consider connecting a wire between the control box and a metal screw on the pedal to further reduce interference. In addition, I can also provide you with a step-by-step solution specifically for interference issues related to the Fanatec CLS DD base.      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.",

The current version has some issues during testing where the motor stop command was not received correctly, but this has already been fixed. In addition, if you experience abnormal brake vibration, you can try using nylon screws and washers to isolate the brake VAM Pro motor from the bracket, which will completely eliminate EMI interference with the pedals. When convenient, please send us a screenshot showing the brake VAM Pro strength settings so that we can verify them. Before replacing the screws with nylon ones, you may also download the VKB JoyTester tool from Google to check whether the motor is interfering with the brake signal. ",

      "body_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have some more information,\r\n\r\nSome users on reddit claim the same issue with the pro x ultra’s but not with the plus x pedals. Also there is 1 person that now uses 2 control boxes. Pro x ultra’s for the pedals and plus x for the VAM Pro’s that also fixed it. So i think it is a firmware issue on the pro x ultra’s control box. (Vibrating longer then needed)\r\n\r\nStef\r\n\r\n",

Please note that this is a software bug in SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0, not a firmware problem. We will soon release SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1 along with a new firmware version, which will fix this issue.
