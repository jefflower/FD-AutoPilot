  "description_text": "Hi, sorry for the late reply however I only now have had some free time. I\r\nrecently bought a product from your collection ( on the 1st of october 2025\r\nat 20:58:53) in the form of the \"Simsonn Racing Simulator Leather Steering\r\nWheel\" and to be honest with you the quality of the product is far, *far, *from\r\nwhat I expected at the pricing of the product. And for this reason I would\r\nlike to request a full refund of the product.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of all the problems which I had with the product:\r\n\r\n1. Poor quality leather - I believe that at this price range I would get\r\nleather that is at least some resistant and sweat, this was not the case!\r\nOnly an hour or 2 after using the leather around the steering wheel started\r\nto feel rougher and rougher with each passing minute and at which point my\r\nhand started being covered in black particles from the leather not being\r\nable to sustain moderate use.\r\n\r\n2. The quality of the buttons. Although some buttons like the red switches\r\nI did find to be pretty good and a nice addition, this quality did not\r\npersist in the rest of the products' buttons. For example, my biggest\r\nproblem is in the physical buttons which have really long travel and which\r\nfeel like you're not even pressing them half the time.\r\n\r\n3. Really loud switches/ clicks in the shifter pads. This one is pretty\r\nself explanatory but I have tried many different wheels like the ones from\r\nSimagic or the Logitech wheels and all were *nowhere *close to as loud as\r\nthe ones on this wheel.\r\n\r\n4. Lack of customization/ missing items from the box. I watched some\r\nreviews of the wheel before buying it and saw that people received stickers\r\nwith their package which could be put on the wheel. However, I did not\r\nreceive any of these with mine and more weirdly mine came with pre-applied\r\nstickers which makes me wonder if the wheel I was sent was used before.\r\n\r\n5. Poor stitching quality. As mentioned above I used the wheel for a total\r\nof around 1-2 hours and in those 1-2 hours the stitching around the leather\r\nstarted to become fizzy and almost looks like it's starting to come off. I\r\ncan't even stand to imagine what this will become after even a full day or\r\n2 of use.\r\n\r\n6. The last problem I will mention is the lack of support in the\r\nSimsonn software. This could have been my mistake but I also bought some\r\npedals a while ago which I was and still am really satisfied with but when\r\nusing the pedals with the Simsonn manager app I could see that there were\r\nsections for a steering wheel in the app however no mention of wheels being\r\ncompatible with that. And because of that I believed that the wheels sold\r\nby you are actually compatible with it. However, as you might know this is\r\nnot the case but I spent almost an hour trying to troubleshoot why it was\r\nnot connecting as there was no actual indication that the wheel was\r\nactually connected.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to request that I be refunded for this and I am happy\r\nto send back the wheel as soon as you approve it. I do want to mention that\r\nthe wheel was fitted with a 3rd party adapter from Moza as the one you sold\r\nwith the wheel had to information on being compatible or not with Simagic\r\nwheel bases.\r\nThank you for your time and hope we can come to an agreement.\r\n\r\nYour sincerely,\r\nAlex Ancuta\r\n\r\n",
