I\r\nam gonna need an invoice issued on my business name so I could include the\r\npurchase in my company expenses. Should I place an order using shopping\r\ncart on your site or do you have different way for business clients ?\r\n\r\nAlso I could be interested in selling your gear here in Poland. Would be\r\nhappy to have a look on your wholesale offer.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nPiotr Grajek\r\n\r\n",
