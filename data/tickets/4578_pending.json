  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy name is Patrick, and I’ve been running YOJI720, the largest simracing\r\nYouTube channel in Poland, for over 12 years.\r\n\r\nI’ve been following your brand for quite some time and really appreciate\r\nthe way you make high-quality, affordable simracing pedals accessible to\r\nthe community. However, I’ve noticed that there are currently no Polish\r\nYouTube reviews of your products and I’d love to change that.\r\n\r\nI’d like to create a dedicated video review of your Black Simsonn Plus X\r\npedals with pedal plate and present them to my audience. My goal would be\r\nto showcase the product’s quality, performance, and value. Potentially\r\nopening the door to new customers from the growing Polish simracing market.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to receive a review unit of the pedals for this\r\ncollaboration?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nYoji720\r\n-- \r\n*Yoji720** - YouTuber, streamer *\r\nYouTube <https://www.youtube.com/yoji720> | Instagram\r\n<http://instagram.com/yoji720> | TikTok <https://www.tiktok.com/@yoji_720> |\r\n Twitch <https://www.twitch.tv/yoji720>\r\n\r\n",
