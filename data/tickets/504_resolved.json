They don't recognize that they are connected in\r\ncalibration mode.\r\n\r\nIn the computer's device manager, an error message appears about the USB\r\ndevice. I've already changed the inputs, restarted it, and tried to fix the\r\nerror, but nothing works. Could you help me with a solution?\r\n\r\n",
