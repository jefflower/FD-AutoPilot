I've had 2 tracking numbers from 'SF'\n\nSF6045986860972\nSF6045986860945\n\nBoth of them cannot be found on SF website.\n\nI also had 1 tracking number from 'Evri' which came on 24th October. This has been stuck ever since and not changed. I have also reached out for further support from Evri.\n\nH01SRA0034612475\n\nI would appreciate any assistance if possible,\n\nThank you,\nMaxim Zotov\nhttps://proton.me/mail/home\r\n",
