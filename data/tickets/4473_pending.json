  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have recently purchased and received the Plus X Pedal set and VAM Pro\r\nmodules. I am trying to install the grounding wire to the control box,\r\nhowever, it seems the rivet where the arrow points to is installed too\r\ntightly to the box, and I cannot slot the ground wire tab under it. What is\r\nthe solution from here? Can I install it some other way? I was not provided\r\nwith a tool that is compatible with the head on that rivet/bolt, I cannot\r\nmake it looser.\r\n\r\n",
