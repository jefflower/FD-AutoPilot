  "description_text": "Hi Team,\r\nI have the SIMSONN PRO Sim Racing Pedals PC Racing Simulator Pedals\r\nPressure Sensor 200KG Load Cell Brake Pedal HE Hydraulic Pedal Black\r\n(P3-H3). Perched May 2024. I have upgraded to the Plus X Control Box to\r\nallow me to use your VAM Pro Linear Motors.\r\n\r\nUsing your Simsonn Manager v2.1.2 software my Pedals show as SIMSONN Plus X\r\n(CPU1:v2.0.5 CPU2:v2.0.4).\r\n[image: image.png]\r\nThere are many issues with games I have tested where the VAM motors lock up\r\nand constantly rumble after just 10 to 15 minutes requiring me to\r\ndisconnect the power to stop them.\r\nFor this reason and also the additional options I am using Simhub. The\r\nissue I am having in Simhub is that it does appear to recognize the pedals\r\ncalibration. The Break start dead zone is ignored, this is easily tweaked\r\nin game but only happens when using Simhub. But the issue I am\r\nstruggling most with is my Throttle will not go to 100% in game when fully\r\npressed. In games where I can adjust the end deadzone I can dial it out but\r\nIt needs adjusting constantly. For games that dont have this setting I have\r\ntried using linearity but this reduces the pedal throw a lot and is not a\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nDo you have any solution for me to get my pedals working with Simhub. My\r\nfriend is using Simhub with his Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedals and is not\r\nhaving the same issues.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n",

You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
