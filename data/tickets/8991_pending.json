I am still\r\nunclear on what is driving that usage, so I agree it is best to close the\r\nsoftware while gaming since it is not required.\r\n\r\nWhile I have this ticket open, I would like to suggest an improvement\r\nregarding the splash screen. Currently, the \"always on top\" logo appears\r\nfor about 15 seconds every time the app launches. If I need to make a quick\r\nadjustment to my pedals during a race, this prevents me from seeing\r\nanything else on my screen. It would be very helpful if there were an\r\noption to disable the splash screen or have the app launch in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nLindell\r\n\r\nOn Fri, 26 Dec 2025 at 22:40, service@simsonn.com ",
