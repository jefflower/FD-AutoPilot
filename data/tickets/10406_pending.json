  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn team,\r\n\r\nI purchased the HS Pro Shifter the H/SQ Dual-Mode Racing Simulation Shifter\r\non 02/12/2025, and I received it in perfect order on 06/01/2025. My order\r\nnumber is #SSN4315.\r\n\r\nI have to say the build quality is great, the knob, gate, body, buttons and\r\nthe act of shifting have an excellent feel.\r\n\r\nI then mounted it to my cockpit, plugged in the USB cord, and windows\r\nrecognised it with no issues, but it was stuck in sequential mode with no\r\nway to change it.\r\n\r\nIn the manual it tells me to download the Simsonn Manager, which I did, and\r\nI am on the latest version (2.1.2)\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the HS PRO Shifter is not detected or recognised in any\r\nway when it should be an automatic process, and I'm stuck on the pedal page\r\nand can't click on anything because the pedal is (obviously) disconnected\r\nas I don't have it.\r\n\r\nIt's not even an option at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nIn your support Manuals page, the HS PRO is also nowhere to be found.\r\nhttps://www.simsonn.com/pages/simsonn-product-manuals\r\n\r\nIn the physical manual I got in the box, it clearly shows the shifter being\r\nrecognised and available within Simsonn Manager, but that's clearly not the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSo I'm writing to ask if there's an ETA for adding the HS PRO shifter in\r\nthe manager, and when will the new version be released?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nVinny Fonseca.\r\n\r\n",
