  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Customer Support,\r\n\r\nDuring the recent Black Friday sales, I purchased a set of Simsonn Plus X pedals from a seller on AliExpress<https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzGyucY>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the clutch pedal has been making a persistent and fairly loud squeaking noise. I attempted re-lubricating the shaft with PTFE dry spray as recommended in the manual, but the issue remains. It was quiet for the first 5-6 pedal presses and then the squeaking returned.\r\n\r\nI have attached the purchase invoice and a recording of the noise.\r\n\r\nHow can I fix this?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nErik Ussin\r\n\r\n",
