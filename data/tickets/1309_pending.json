I paid for better shipping and was told in a prior email that yesterday July 6th was gonna be the date it should have been arriving and it has not arrived and the shipping tracking hasn't updated at all. I would just like an update or something on what's going on. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMaxwell Newman\r\n",
