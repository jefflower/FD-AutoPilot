      "body_text": "Hi Dan K.,     We noticed your feedback that the red damper feels too stiff. Please note that it is a silicone damper, available in standard hardness levels of 60HA, 70HA, and 80HA. The stiffness you feel may be due to a short travel setting. Please refer to the following guide for adjustment.       Our brake spring incorporates a 10 mm travel-limiting spacer, designed primarily to simulate the brake travel of Formula 1 cars.    With the spacer installed, it delivers the short-travel feel typical of F1 braking.    With the spacer removed, the brake pedal travel is increased, making it better suited for rally racing.    Specifications:    Spring length: 16.5 mm    Spacer thickness: 10 mm    Effective travel with spacer: (16.5−10)÷2=3.25 mm(16.5 - 10) ÷ 2 = 3.25\\text{ mm}(16.5−10)÷2=3.25 mm   Effective travel without spacer: 16.5÷2=8.25 mm16.5 ÷ 2 = 8.25\\text{ mm}16.5÷2=8.25 mm   Removing the spacer significantly increases the spring’s working travel, providing a softer pedal feel that is more suitable for prolonged braking and the varied conditions of rally racing.",

      "body_text": "Hello, thank you for the information on the stiffness. But my bigger\r\nproblem is that I can’t mount the pedals to my cockpit making them\r\nunusable. My cockpit is the rs6 trak racer do you have any information on\r\nthat and how can I fix that the only pictures I can provide right now are\r\nthe two below. Basically the simsonn baseplate is bigger than the trak\r\nracer baseplate and in order to mount them together I would need to drill\r\nholes which is something I would like to avoid as I am not a professional\r\nand I wouldn’t like to damage any of my equipment. I would really\r\nappreciate it f you could help me.\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 6 Aug 2025 at 03:55, service@simsonn.com ",
