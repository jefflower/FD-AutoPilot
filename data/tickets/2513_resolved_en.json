  "description_text": "Hi. I have a problem with a break pedal in Simsonn black pro plus pedals. I was doing a race, everything was fine. After race i've wanted to restore my previous calibration settings in a Simpedalsconfig_v4 program. I've clicked \"load calibration\" and after that my brake pedal looks like unrecognisable. I can't calibrate it, nothing.\nhttps://youtu.be/fL7X1i2eIf4",
