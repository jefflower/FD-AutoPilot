  "description_text": "Hi SIMSONN Team,\r\n\r\ni was using Plus X Pedal Kit it for weeks without problems, but yesterday it stopped working. the light inside does go on when i plug in with USB and 24V PSU for the Active Feedback Actuator (have 1x on brake ) . I searched online and tried to hold the reset button while plugging in to the PC, but it does not appear in SIMSONN manager or windows device manager. i tried 3 different cables, directly plugged in to PC in the mainboard. I unscrewed the box top, to take a look, but it looks fine, nothing burned. I would love to get any help.\r\n\r\nI bought the Kit on Amazon \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nGreetings Oleks \r\n",
