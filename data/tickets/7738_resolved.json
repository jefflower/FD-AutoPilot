  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased the Simsonn plus x pedal set Order #SSN3720.\r\nWhen I have both my wheel and pedals turned on at the same time, I have a\r\nlot of static from the break pedal input. Is there any way to fix this as I\r\ncan't use the pedals like this?\r\n\r\nIn the attached video, I have the wheel base turned on, then I turn it off\r\nand then I turn it back on again.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n-- \r\nKevin Iseborn\r\nkeviniseborn@googlemail.com\r\n+44 7718276785\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Kevin I,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
