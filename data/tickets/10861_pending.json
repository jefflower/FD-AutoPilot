I have installed the app multiple time and that doesn't seem to work. I have also moved the grounding wire around but that has not changed anything.\r\nthe calibration works in the Simsonn app but as soon as i try calibrate in a  game there is no input.\r\n\r\n",

Then send me the link and set the sharing permission to “Anyone with the link can view.” The video should include the full process below (including zeroing the pedal signal following the steps inside the Offset pop-up dialog, and then Calibration/Calibrate):    Click Offset, and follow the steps in the pop-up dialog to zero the pedal signal;    Click Calibrate, then press each pedal with normal force;    Click Save;    After calibration, please test the pedals again — the blue progress bar should move smoothly from 0% to 100%. Only then is the calibration successful.",
