  "description_text": "Hello,\n\nI placed an order on November 20 under the number SSN3679.\n\nI paid for express delivery, which is between 3-7 days, as it was a gift. However, it is now December 9th, and 19 days have already passed with no notice of when it will be delivered.\n\nIt seems I paid for a service that I did not receive, so I would like to have my money returned. After this bad experience, I will never try to buy here again.\n\nThank you.",
