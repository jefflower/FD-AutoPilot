  "description_text": "Hi there. Does your product “Simsonn racing simulator sequential shifter”\r\nplug into a Fanatec wheel base. If it does does that mean it would work\r\nwith Xbox. I’m only asking because I see that other products say that it\r\nwon’t work with the q box and this doesn’t say it isn’t compatible with\r\nanything. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.\r\n\r\n",

Because the power wiring sequence is different, plugging it directly into a Fanatec base may cause damage to the device.",
