  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Affiliate Team,\r\n\r\nI am writing this as a final notice regarding my overdue payment of $75.80.\r\nDespite my patience and previous polite follow-ups, this issue remains\r\nunresolved.\r\n\r\nLet me be clear: My patience has run out.\r\n\r\nIf this payment is not processed immediately, I will be forced to escalate\r\nthis matter publicly. We are prepared to deploy our resources to launch a\r\nwidespread campaign across all major social media platforms and affiliate\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nWe will explicitly warn all current and potential partners that Simsonn is\r\nengaging in fraudulent practices by withholding commissions. We will ensure\r\nthis \"scam\" behavior is exposed everywhere so that no other partners fall\r\nvictim to this.\r\n\r\nI strongly suggest you settle this payment immediately to avoid irreparable\r\ndamage to your brand's reputation.\r\n\r\nI expect a confirmation of payment within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid Long\r\n\r\n",
