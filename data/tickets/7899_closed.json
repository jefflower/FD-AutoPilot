  "description_text": "I ordered the Plus X pedals with the haptic motor kits a few weeks ago and the package was delivered last week. When I opened the box, the pedals and their accessories were there, but there were no haptic motors, as well as the separate U-mounts that I purchased as well. I’ve attached pictures of what was received. I sent an email to service@simsonn.com and got an automated response the next day (Sunday) saying my ticket had been received and that I would be getting a personal response within 24 hours. It has now been three days and I’ve yet to receive any response. In the meantime, I’ve got multiple responses on a technical issue, and all of them seem to either ignore or just not understand the issue that I’m having. I’m at the point where I want my money back. The item itself is actually pretty good when I can use it, but the support I’ve received so far has soured me on your company. If I don’t receive some sort of response on my initial request about the missing haptics, I will be sending what I have left back and expecting a full refund as well as having the return shipping cost covered. Thank you for your time and hopefully quick response. Michael Shreve",
