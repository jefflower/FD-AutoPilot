  "description_text": "Hello\r\nI recently purchased your VAM rumble reactors (non-pro) and proceeded to\r\ninstall it including the software. In your advertisement on Amazon and your\r\nofficial website seems to indicate that it and the software is supposed to\r\nbe compatible with SIM hud. Attached below is the image in reference\r\n\r\n\r\nNow my question is basically how do I get it to work with SIM hub? I have\r\ngotten it to work directly with iRacing but that does not leave me my\r\npreferred customisability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time\r\n?\r\n\r\n",

Please connect the power first, test the vibration in Simsonn Manager 2.1.0, and once it works properly, add our device in SimHub and run a test. ",
