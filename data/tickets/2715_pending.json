  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the VAM Pro Haptic Reactors. If I am ordering\r\nthe bundle with the power supply to germany, does the power supply comes\r\nwith a power plug for germany? I am asking because the product photo shows\r\na power plug which will not fit in the german system.\r\n\r\nThank you very much! Really looking forward hearing from you :)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nHaris Murselji\r\n\r\n",
