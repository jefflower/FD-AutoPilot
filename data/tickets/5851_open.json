The item is in its original packaging in new condition\r\n\r\nThank you for your help,\r\n\r\nJack Artherton\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Jack Artherton,    The throttle uses a single-direction hydraulic damper, and the sound of liquid movement inside is completely normal—it’s not caused by blockage or malfunction. When applying strong brake force, please make sure that the pedal base plate is securely fixed, otherwise the whole pedal assembly might produce noise due to insufficient support.  For connection or signal interruption issues, we recommend the following grounding solution:    Connect the PC case to the simulator frame;    Connect the main controller box to any metal screw on the pedal.    This can effectively improve stability. The main cause of such problems is usually that the wall outlet your PC is plugged into does not have a reliable three-prong ground, resulting in unstable grounding.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
