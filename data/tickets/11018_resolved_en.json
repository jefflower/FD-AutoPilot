  "description_text": "Hello. I received the pedalboard, I'm happy with it. However, for the haptic motors, they remain on and vibrating. Even cutting the game doesn't solve the problem. I did put the nylon washers between the motor and the support but I don't have nylon screws as some say. Thank you.",

      "body_text": "Hi Adrien_hrl, Please uninstall the SIMSONN Manager currently installed on your PC, then download and install the latest SIMSONN Manager v2.1.3 from our official website. After installation, please update the device firmware to: CPU1: 2.0.6, CPU2: 2.0.4. Once the update is complete, unplug and replug the device, then test again. Additionally, we recommend using a wire to connect the PC chassis/case and the controller box screw/metal housing to a common ground. This often helps reduce interference and can resolve signal dropouts/disconnections. Finally, please plug the device directly into a rear USB 3.0 (blue) port on your PC, and avoid using any USB hubs, to ensure stable power and data connection.",
