  "description_text": "Hi SimSonn Team,\r\n\r\nI’m Mohammed Muhaiminur Rahman from Bangladesh, and I’m developing a series\r\nof sim racing videos focused on gear, setup guides, and the rapid growth of\r\ncompetitive sim racing in the region.\r\n\r\nBangladesh is an open, under-served market where most racers still use\r\nbasic gear-driven wheels like the Logitech G29, yet many are now upgrading\r\ntheir setups as direct-drive wheels and stronger bases slowly become more\r\npopular. This makes high-quality pedals, shifters, and handbrakes a prime\r\nupgrade path and SimSonn is already a well-known choice among enthusiasts\r\nlooking to step up their hardware.\r\n\r\nThere’s a strong opportunity for SimSonn to establish a dominant presence\r\nhere by showcasing your pedal and peripheral lineup before the market fully\r\ntransitions into more advanced sim racing gear.\r\n\r\nI’m producing both short-form content for Instagram and YouTube, as well as\r\na detailed long-form review. Content rollout is planned for late January to\r\nearly February after thorough testing and editing. I’m open to reviewing\r\nwhichever product you feel best fits your current promotional goals.\r\n\r\nIf this aligns with your direction, I’m happy to share audience details and\r\ncontent plans.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMohammed Muhaiminur Rahman\r\nInstagram Page <https://www.instagram.com/splon.ki> | Youtube Page\r\n<https://www.youtube.com/@splonki781> | Email <muhit5869@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n",
