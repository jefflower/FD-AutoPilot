  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust want to confirm the base plate and heel plate sizing. I can see in the\r\naccessories page the dimensions of them but they do look slightly\r\ndifferent. Can you please confirm the size and the heel plate width.\r\nI have a maximum of 340mm so the main size I need is the carbon heel plate\r\nwidth. I'm confident I can cut down the base plate to suit.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n",
