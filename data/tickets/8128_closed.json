To open these items, just  \r\nclick the links above.\r\n\r\nattached are the videos of me trying to do the tests. I also uploaded a  \r\npicture of the upload settings being \" default prox\" even though I have  \r\nplus x pedals. Is this normal or do I need to adjust something on that end  \r\nas well? i was also curious where i would put the ground exactly on the  \r\nthrottle pedal? i figured i would use the grounding wire that came with my  \r\nshipment.\r\n\r\n",
