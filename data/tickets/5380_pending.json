  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI just ordered the pedalset Simsonn plus X in black. I wanted to order it\r\nwith the baseplate but due to the website projecting the prices in usd\r\ninstead of euros i noticed only after I ordered them without. Is it\r\npossible to still add this to the current order? I payed for express\r\nshipping and don't want to play the charge again for a separate order if\r\nnot necessary.\r\n\r\nMy 2nd question is about the import tax and VAT. Is it possible to list the\r\nitem as VAT compliant or as a gift? Money is kinda tight and I want to\r\navoid having to pay extra for import if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks alot in advance and I hope to hear from you soon,\r\nHave a great day and best regards,\r\nJordy\r\n\r\n",
