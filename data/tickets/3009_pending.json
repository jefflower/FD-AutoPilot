      "body_text": "Hi Becbec,     Thank you for your detailed feedback. Please first test with the 2.1.1 version from this link: go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-pedals-proxultra.sfu, and then run the test again.  Additionally, for the brake pedal’s VAM, we recommend using nylon screws and washers, as this can effectively reduce VAM Pro interference on the pedal signal. For the control box, you may also try connecting a wire to any screw on the pedal, but please note that metal materials may affect the connection quality.  If the issue still persists, we will immediately report it to our software development team, have them check and fix the bug as soon as possible, and provide you with an updated version for upgrade at the earliest opportunity.    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UPkeOHREyALtCtNmL87a2WnUDZV0Gx_b/view?usp=drive_link",
