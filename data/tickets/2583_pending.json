  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm a proud owner of Simsonn Pro Plus pedals and I'm very happy about them.\r\nI'm thinking about purchasing a 3x VAM Pro Set but I have a small question\r\nabout the power supply. I live in France and I was wondering if the power\r\noutlet was catered to the country of purchase (we use type-C power outlets)\r\nor if it was the same for everyone ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your response\r\nBest regards\r\n-- \r\nVictor LABOUYRIE\r\n\r\n",
