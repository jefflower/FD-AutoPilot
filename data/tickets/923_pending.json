  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm in the USA, and want to purchase the 3 pedal PLUS X pedal set with \r\nthe base plate.\r\n\r\nI can order from your website and the total is $284.28 plus around $12 \r\nshipping and maybe plus tax with discount code SRC.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can also order on your ebay store and the total is $279.26 \r\nwith free shipping plus tax.\r\n\r\nIt seems I should purchase these on your ebay store as it may be a bit \r\ncheaper.  Are there any advantages or disadvantages to ordering on your \r\nebay store vs. your online store?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBrian Jones\r\nUS 502.262.0108\r\n\r\n\r\n",
