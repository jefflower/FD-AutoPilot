  "description_text": "Good morning,\n\nSimsonn Official Store on AliExpress\nOrder ID: 1114304356501062\nTracking No: 882628894934\nItem: Simsonn Black Plus X P2-H2\n\nYesterday, Fedex emailed me and requesting for a screenshot of proof of payment and aliexpress order confirmation from the app, I have sent them right away, not knowing that they have attatched a sales invoice from the store. To my surprise it was declared for a lower value $68 (₱3841). It was way under valued. You guys didn’t ask my permission to be like that. Here in Philippines if the item was below $180 (₱10000), I will not pay for an import tax and I do not know why you guys undervalued my item. I’ve sent them my online banking receipt showing that it was $150 (₱8524). Now there’s a discrepancy which will take the shipping longer. I will attached the screenshot of the current status of the package and I am requesting for you guys to correct the value of my order so it can be clear from the customs as soon as possible.\n\nThank you,\n\nWillbert Oanes (A1RMAX GT)",
