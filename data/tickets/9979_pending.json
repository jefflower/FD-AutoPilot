  "description_text": "Dear sirs,\r\nI would like to point out, that your hardware is working great! However the\r\nsoftware, Simsonn manager to be exact, is lagging and it's lagging the\r\nwhole PC.\r\nCan there be a quick solution or does there need to be an update to the\r\nsoftware?\r\nOnce I close the Simsonn manager the lagging goes away.\r\n\r\nThank you for your response.\r\n\r\nZdenek Novotny\r\n\r\n",
