      "body_text": "Hi Mykola Shershen,   Our throttle pedal is equipped with a custom one-way hydraulic rod. The rod contains fluid, so it is normal to hear a water-like sound during movement. If you notice other unusual noises, you can apply silicone-based lubricant to the key parts of the pedal according to the manual. Make sure the silver rod of the hydraulic unit is clean and free of dust particles before lubrication. If the problem persists, please record a video and send it to us via Google Drive, ensuring that the viewing permissions are set. ",
