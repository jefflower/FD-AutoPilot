  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a haptic kit on order #SSN1814.\r\n\r\nI have installed everything correctly and have updated the pedal box to cpu\r\nversion:2.0.2.\r\n\r\nBut after a short period of testing, the box now freezes and the motors\r\ncontinue to shake while no input is being sent to the box. Secondly, the\r\nconnection to the usb to the pc then loses connectivity. After power\r\ncycling the box, it connects again.\r\n\r\nIf you go to the simsonn manager and send a vibration, the unit then\r\nfreezes and a power cycle is then required to stop the vibration.\r\n\r\nI then did a manual update and returned the unit to the original firmware,\r\nbut the same issue is still occurring.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nHeath Greenland\r\n*0400132481*\r\n\r\n",

Also, to help us troubleshoot the USB disconnection issue, please try the following steps:      Turn off the wheelbase power;  Disconnect all other USB devices, keeping only our pedals, keyboard, and mouse connected;  Do not plug in the motor;  Connect the pedal’s USB and power supply only;  Open the software and click “Test” to check if the USB disconnection still occurs.         This issue seems unusual, and these steps will help us better understand the cause. Thank you for your cooperation!",
