  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI believe my spring mount spacer broke, and I’m wondering what parts kit I need to purchase to replace it.  I believe I have the original pro pedals.  I originally purchased them in Ali Express, order id 8184498586407087.\r\n\r\nI’m just specifically looking to replace the mounting spacer but I'm willing to purchase an upgrade kit. Can you direct me to what I need to fix my pedals?\r\n\r\n[image0.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[image1.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[image2.jpeg]\r\n\r\n",
