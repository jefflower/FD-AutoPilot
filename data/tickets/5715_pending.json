  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn,\r\n\r\nI hope you’re doing well.\r\nI just received the DHL tracking number for my pedal order (CE326630069DE),\r\nand I noticed that the shipment appears to be going from Germany to the\r\nNetherlands. Since I’m located in Budapest, I wanted to check if this\r\nrouting is normal or if there might be an issue with the delivery.\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm that the package is on the correct route and still\r\nexpected to arrive in Hungary?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nBotond Nyilas\r\n\r\n",
