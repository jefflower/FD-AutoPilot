  "subject": "Insane customs tax after my pedals were re-sent",
  "description_text": "I initially ordered my pedals in November of last year, and they got lost\r\nin the middle of shipping.\r\nBefore they got lost, I got asked by simsonn to pay $40 extra for the\r\nshipping and customs declaration. When i got the confirmation that they\r\nwere lost, i sent an email to this address and got a reply days later, and\r\nthe pedals got re-sent. This time, it worked, and the delivery is expected\r\nfor January 22nd. But now, i got an email from DHL that i have to pay $183\r\nfor my package to be delivered. This is an insane price, almost as much as\r\nthe pedals themselves. This was unexpected, especially considering the\r\nprevious payment and re-send.\r\nAt this point, i'd rather just get a refund and send the pedals back,\r\nbecause this price is way too high to be worth it.\r\nI just want to know if i can get any help with it, whether that be a refund\r\nand shipping it back or at least partial coverage of this.\r\n\r\n",
