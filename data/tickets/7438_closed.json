  "description_text": "Hi, \r\nGot my Pro X Ultra pedals in June a couple days back my throttle pedal isn’t getting any input neither in game nor in the Simsonn manager app. \r\nAfter inspection and removing the hydraulic damper noticed the spring had just fallen, but there is nothing really that it can hold on to… as if it’s missing a piece.\r\nTried to reposition the spring in between the screws from the pedal and load cell respectively. This resulted in the Simsonn app receiving input from the throttle pedal but not in a normal way. \r\nNow I have to depress the pedal about 40% before it shows a any input, the reading is unstable even after calibration which I tried a few times.\r\nI’m hoping we can resolve this issue soon since I just got my Simsonn haptic reactors and I really wanted to install them and use.\r\nHerby I attached my purchase invoice and a few photos of the issue.\r\nLet me know if you require something else\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
