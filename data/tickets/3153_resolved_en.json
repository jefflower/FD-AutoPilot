Are you currently using the USB 3.0 port (blue) on the back of your PC? Please avoid using USB hubs without independent power. Could you take a photo showing your pedal connections and the SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 software screen? I can help you check whether the installation and software version are working correctly. ",
