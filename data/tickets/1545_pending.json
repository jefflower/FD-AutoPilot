It was intentionally designed as a spacing control bearing to prevent the pedal arm from shifting toward the center under high pressure. This design will not cause any looseness.  The video you provided appears to be incomplete or failed to upload correctly — we're currently unable to view it. Please try re-uploading the full video or sharing a link via a platform like Google Drive or Dropbox so we can assist you further.",
