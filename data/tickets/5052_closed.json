This is an encouraging\r\nmilestone, and I am excited to contribute to the growth of your brand. In\r\naddition to sharing this good news, I would also like to ask you to clarify\r\na few issues regarding the commission payment process. Specifically, I\r\nwould like to understand:\r\n\r\nIs there a minimum payment threshold that must be met before commissions\r\nare paid?\r\n\r\n What is the standard payment schedule?\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected timeframe for processing payments when they are due?\r\n\r\n Understanding these details will help me better manage my profile and\r\nstrategy in the future. Thank you for your time and support. I am very\r\nexcited about our partnership and look forward to many more successful\r\ncollaborations.
