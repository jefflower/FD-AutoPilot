And using Vam Pro can only vibrate in one direction, and the intensity is lower than Pro X Ultra. You can check the precautions point 3. If you need stronger vibration, you can choose Vam. If you need a better feeling, you can choose Vam pro. We will give you a Pro X Ultra control box or motherboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We recommend purchasing the ProX Ultra controller, which offers the best support for the VAM Pro. The Ultra version features upgraded hardware specifically designed to drive the VAM Pro more effectively. We will be listing the ProX Ultra controller board on our store soon — please stay tuned. ",
