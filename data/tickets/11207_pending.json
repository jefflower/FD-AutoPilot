I was thinking of buying the Simsonn HB Pro handbrake but the\r\nquestion im asking is that do you ship them from Germany and do i need to\r\npay like custom duties or any hidden extra costs? I bought sometime ago the\r\nplus x pedals and i am LOVING them so far! Really looking forward to\r\nhearing from you so i can complete my purchase. I am ordering from Finland!\r\nBest regards Eeka.\r\n\r\n",
