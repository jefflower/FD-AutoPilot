After the update, the device version should display as CPU1: 2.0.5, CPU2: 2.0.3. If the issue still persists, please feel free to contact me.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download     When you plug in the 24V independent power supply, seeing a small spark is completely normal — it’s caused by the capacitors in the motor circuit charging. Please rest assured, this is a safe 24V power source with no risk or danger, and it won’t damage the controller. There’s also no need to frequently plug or unplug the power.  In addition, if the LEDs stay on after the computer is turned off, that’s because some motherboards continue to supply power to the USB ports even when shut down. This is part of the motherboard’s design, and the pedals cannot detect whether the PC is powered off.",
