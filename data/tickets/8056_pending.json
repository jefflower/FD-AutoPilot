It's been 3 months,\r\nalthough the stated delivery time is 5-12 days. If you are unable to\r\ndeliver the order or predict the delivery time, refund the money. I need a\r\nclear answer.: Are you able to deliver the order within the next month or\r\nnot (before January 12th)? If not, return my money.\r\n\r\n",
