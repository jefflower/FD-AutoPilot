Also, make sure the device is connected directly to a rear USB 3.0 (blue) port on your PC, not through a hub.  Is our Simsonn Manager software not detecting your device?",

However, our pedals cannot be connected directly to a Fanatec wheelbase — they must be connected to the PC via USB. In addition, the 6P6C port on our pedals is reserved for our upcoming wheelbase and is not compatible with other brands’ bases. ",
