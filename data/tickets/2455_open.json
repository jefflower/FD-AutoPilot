Due to stock shortages at our warehouse in Germany, we plan to wait until around the 11th for new goods to arrive at the German warehouse before shipping your order. This will help avoid customs duties. Since we have always shipped goods to Croatia via our German warehouse, we are unsure whether shipping directly from China would result in unusually high taxes. If you need the items urgently, we can ship them to you via UPS. Please let us know your preference as soon as possible.",
