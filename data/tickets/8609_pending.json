I currently have the entry level fanatec csl dd 5nm setup. I don’t really need a clutch but I’m looking for pedals that will help me going forward and from what I’m reading it looks like haptics will help along with better pedals then what I’m currently using. And I’ve been looking into your pedals for a few days now I’m just needing pointed in the right direction.\n\nThank you for your time\n\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS.\r\n",
