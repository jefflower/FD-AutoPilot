  "description_text": "Hello, today I received just the VAM Pros that I ordered but I haven't\r\nreceived the Plus X pedals. Since they seemingly came in a different\r\npackage. But I don't have a second tracking number. I was wondering where I\r\nwould find that or if there was an issue.\r\n\r\nI reached out previously on a different ticket but never received a\r\nresponse on that one. I added a comment but didn't know if that was the\r\nbest way to reach out so I figured I should open a new ticket since it was\r\na new issue.\r\n\r\nI also reached out on an Amazon seller message. I look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
