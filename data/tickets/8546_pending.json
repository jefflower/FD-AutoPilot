Not sure if you can do a code I can use on your site for a dollar amount or if you need me to be more specific on the exact product so the code only applies to the item I'm interested in or even if you need to place the order on your end for some reason. To simplify things 50% off the pro X ultra w/haptics(3 pedals but don't care about clutch haptics)would be amazing but a total discount of $140(50% of my original purchase price) would be perfectly acceptable as well.",

I just want to use my sim. I'm about ready to buy a set of pedals from a different manufacturer to be completely honest. Which is a shame because until now I've loved the product. Being dead for weeks on a product less then a year old and STILL not knowing if, how, or when it will be rectified is not something I'm interested in dealing with in the future. I don't even have a reset or upgrade button on my control box. I've updated the software more then once. I've tried the brake pedal in the throttle and cable ports. The load cells are bad. Please expedite sending now load cells or giving me a generous discount code to purchase a new set with domestic shipping. Simsonn has a 2yr warranty do they not? Please make this right ASAP ",
