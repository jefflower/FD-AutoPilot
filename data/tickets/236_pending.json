I saw additional info on the website now that says pro x can only use VAM pro one direction. The control box I have looks identical to the new ultra hub on the outside it seems, so curious if it will work fully.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n>   \r\n> On May 28, 2025 at 10:32 PM,  <Support (mailto:support@simsonn.com)>  wrote:\r\n>   \r\n>   \r\n>     \r\n>   \r\n> >   \r\n> > >   \r\n> > >   \r\n> > > >   \r\n> > > > Hello, can you help with the order number?\r\n> > > >   \r\n> > >   \r\n> > >   \r\n> >   \r\n>   \r\n>   \r\n>\r\n>     \r\n>   \r\n>     \r\n> support@simsonn.com\r\n>   \r\n>   \r\n>   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> > From:   Kyle Emfinger1 (mailto:kyle.emfinger1@gmail.com)\r\n> >   \r\n> > Date:   2025-05-28   21:50\r\n> >   \r\n> > To:   Support (mailto:support@simsonn.com)\r\n> >   \r\n> > Subject:   Re: Re: USA Warehouse\r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >   \r\n> >\r\n> >  Hi, I ordered the pro X upgraded pedals last week, not the newer pro X ultra.

However, if you need the full VAM Pro experience, you’ll need to purchase the vibration motor, power supply, and a ProX Ultra control board directly from our official website. All items are shipped from China using UPS, and delivery to the U.S. typically takes only 3–5 days, which is quite fast. ",
