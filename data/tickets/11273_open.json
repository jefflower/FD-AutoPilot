I have been in contact with UPS, and the total amount for customs duties, taxes, and brokerage fees is 150 €. Before I proceed with the payment to UPS, I need your formal written confirmation regarding the following points: Do you agree to reimburse the full amount of 150 € upon receiving the invoice? How many days will it take to process the refund after I send you the receipt? Which payment method will you use for the reimbursement? Please consider your reply as a formal agreement between us. Once I have your clear confirmation on these points, I will immediately pay UPS to receive the package and send you the invoice. I look forward to your confirmation. \r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\n\r\nRémi Zickenheiner\r\n\r\n> Le 20 janv. 2026 à 11:09, service@simsonn.com a écrit :\r\n> \r\n> Hi remi zickenheiner,\r\n> \r\n> Please don't worry.
