The package is now being returned to your warehouse.\r\n\r\nTracking number: 1ZJ455510406322760\r\n\r\nSince I will not be receiving the items, I am requesting a full refund for this order. Please let me know once you have processed the refund or if you need any further information from my side.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRémi Zickenheiner\r\n",
