Since today is Saturday, we originally planned to cancel the order for you on Monday. However, we have already contacted our operations team to work overtime, accessed the system, and processed your refund today.  Additionally, we believe there may have been a misunderstanding. Our website clearly states that the product ships from the United States, not Canada, and that the product price does not include customs duties.  Regarding the customs fee you mentioned, we initially assumed it would be around $20, which is why we proactively offered to cover the difference.  Later, you clarified that the customs fee was actually $140 and mentioned your many years of experience with iRacing. At the time, we didn’t fully understand your point until your most recent email helped make things clearer.  We hope you understand that today is our rest day, and we may not have reviewed your messages carefully at first. The “12-hour” reference was only meant as a reminder that orders typically can’t be canceled once shipped—not to limit your rights. If the item hasn’t shipped, we are always happy to assist with cancellations.  Please don’t misunderstand. For something this straightforward, a refund is absolutely the right thing to do—it should never require threats or frustration. We value every customer and sincerely hope we can communicate in a positive and respectful manner.     SIMSONN Supoort Team",
