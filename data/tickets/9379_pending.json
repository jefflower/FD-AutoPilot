Our products generally cannot be returned after unboxing unless there is a manufacturing defect, as the metallic paint finish easily shows signs of use and cannot be reused.

I only took out the two brake and accelerator mounts without even\r\ninstalling them, because I immediately saw that it wasn't possible for me\r\nto use them.\r\n\r\nIt's like buying shoes, taking them out of the box, and putting them right\r\nback in without even trying them on.\r\n\r\nI therefore ask you to please make an effort to give me a refund.\r\n\r\nWishing you a happy new year,\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nEnzo Jacob\r\n\r\nLe mer. 31 déc. 2025 à 09:53, service@simsonn.com ",
