Even after a number of software updates I continue to have an issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I stop a sim race and exist the race the VAM continues to vibrate. The units have been installed with cable supplied and are isolated from the power cables.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nStephen\r\nStephen Wilson\r\n8A Lang Street, KURRI KURRI, NSW. 2327.

      "body_text": "Hi Stephen Wilson,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

      "body_text": "Hi Stephen Wilson,  Most importantly, use a wire to securely connect the PC chassis to the screws on the main control box, ensuring a common ground. This helps improve system stability and reduce interference.      Many computer motherboards continue to supply power to USB ports even after shutdown. As a result, the pedals’ lights will stay on, since the pedals cannot detect whether the computer is off. You can try turning off the computer’s power switch to completely cut off power. ",
