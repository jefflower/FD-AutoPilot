After taking more than a week longer than expected, and after contacting them many times and being told it would be delivered on Monday, November 3rd, I received an email saying it was delivered on October 31st at 6 PM, and it was received by someone I don't know! I need a solution, please.",

If you have adjusted the mechanical setup, you can use the Offset function to shift the white signal to its initial position. Alternatively, you can ignore the white signal and simply set a 5% dead zone, which will not affect the game output. ",
