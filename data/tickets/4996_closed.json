Also, make sure the USB cable is plugged directly into a rear USB3.0 (blue) port on your computer, rather than through a USB hub. If the issue persists, it might be caused by a damaged USB spring cable. We can send you a replacement for free — please provide your contact name, phone number, and full shipping address. ",
