  "description_text": "Hey,\r\n\r\nI got a VAM PRO as a Christmas present, but it didn’t include the power\r\nsupply. I was wondering if I have to buy the official one from you, or if I\r\ncan use something I already have or purchase a third-party supply with\r\nsimilar power specs.\r\n\r\nIf so, what are the exact power specs for the power supply?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the tax and shipping end up costing more than your\r\npower supply itself.\r\n\r\n",
