  "description_text": "Hello\r\n\r\nOrder no. 205-8346337-2842728. Simsonn ProX Ultra pedal set\r\n\r\n\r\nI have recently ordered the Simsonn Ultra pedals and Haptic motors which\r\nhave only just been delivered.\r\n\r\nI have followed the instructions and connected the haptic motors and upload\r\nthe latest software etc. the software appears to recognise the motors etc\r\nbut the output appears to be very sporadic and intermittent. I’ve been\r\nunable to get any constant output to the motors when applying force to the\r\npedals?\r\n\r\nThe motors do react when I press ‘test’ but again many times I get no\r\nreaction when I press ‘test’ then I get vibration intermittently?\r\n\r\nI’m unable to work out exactly what the issue is but suspect the control\r\nbox is not providing consistent output to the motors? The pedals appear to\r\nwork fine?\r\n\r\nCan you advise if there is anything I can try to resolve please?\r\n\r\nScreenshot of my settings attached\r\n\r\n",
