However, doing it on Amazon I have\r\nto purchase the Haptic Reactors and the Pedals separately rather than\r\ntogether when you go direct.\r\n\r\nWould you be able to please confirm if I buy the pedals from Amazon whether\r\nthey have the capability to add the Haptic Reactors to the pedals?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help.\r\n\r\n",

That's the\r\nmeasurements we've provisionally taken it from.\r\n\r\nThe rig manufacturer has also asked me for the diameter of the spaces\r\nhighlighted in green and if they are M8 or not. That would be really\r\nhelpful if you can share that information when you are able to get it to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Aug 25, 2025 at 4:06 AM service@simsonn.com ",
