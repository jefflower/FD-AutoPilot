  "description_text": "I hope you guys don’t think I’m done. You still need to remove my positive\r\nreview. Just press the same button you use to remove my negative reviews.\r\n\r\nI’m up to 13 confirmed sales that I have cost you between my reddit posts,\r\niracing leagues, and people I personally know. There are likely more that\r\nwere on the fence between you and another brand that I have swayed, that I\r\ndon’t know about. That’s over $2000 in sales because you wanted to falsely\r\nadvertise a coupon and not honor it for $17. When you remove my review and\r\nproperly apologize for this, I will remove my posts trashing your company.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a long rainy weekend coming up where I’ll have some extra time to\r\ncontinue spreading the word about how you treat customers. I’ll probably\r\nget into some other forums and threads I haven’t worked on yet. Still\r\nwaiting for the government to reopen so I can file some complaints with the\r\nproper agencies about violating the Truth in Advertising laws.\r\n\r\nThis could all stop with the click of a button. It could have never started\r\nif you honored the ad discount you emailed me. $17 versus $2000+ along with\r\ncontinuous bad publicity for a company whose products people are very iffy\r\nabout purchasing in the first place.\r\n\r\nSee you this weekend on the forums!\r\n\r\n",
