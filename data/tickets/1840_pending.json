  "description_text": "Hi there. I have Simsonn pro plus pedals and I want to play on Forza horizon 5. The game does not recognise the pedals at all so I’ve tried using freejoy like many others have but for some reason freejoy can’t see my pedals at all in the devices drop down menu. I’ve tried every version of freejoy and still had no luck. Do you have any idea what I could do? \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",

It will prompt “Device too old.” When this happens, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → Firmware → pedals-plus.sfu to complete the update. Once the update is finished, recalibrate the pedals and then go to the test interface to check their functionality.        https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
