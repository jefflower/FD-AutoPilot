I make content for the *non-traditional gamer*: parents,\r\nmultitaskers, and full-time professionals who still make time to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve partnered with brands like Sablute, Foxvox, and Huanuo to highlight\r\ngaming gear through skits, reviews, and green screen setups that show how\r\ngaming fits into a real, busy life. One of my favorite videos pulled in\r\n49K+ views and sold over 25 keyboards - here\r\n<https://www.tiktok.com/@ashley_at_work2/video/7386416969693547807?_r=1&_t=ZT-8vXTg0AW9xS>\r\nit is if you want to check it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy style blends humor, storytelling, and authentic commentary. I focus on\r\nconnecting with gamers who aren't living in a fantasy bubble - they’re\r\njuggling real responsibilities and still leveling up when they can.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d love to help Simsonn reach that audience with content that entertains\r\n*and* converts. Want me to send over a concept idea?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nAshley\r\n\r\nPortfolio <https://ashleythurstonugc.my.canva.site/ashleythurstonugc>\r\n\r\n",
