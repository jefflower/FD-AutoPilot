I have the simsonn pro plus (older version) pedals and I just recently purchased the VAM haptics and for some reason I cannot get the feedback option to show up in any of the software. Have tried installing 2.0.6, 2.0.7, and 2.0.8 and I cannot get the feedback option to come up when I click on pedals. Please help.\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Purestock38j, Did you purchase the PlusX controller and a separate power supply? The latest version 2.0.8 software is all you need. You can also send us a screenshot for confirmation. Additionally, SimHub can be used for setup and testing.      Our software currently supports 10 games. May I ask which game you are using now? We are continuously working to add telemetry support for more titles. In the meantime, you can use the internal version of SimHub that I’ve provided. The official release is still undergoing testing and may take a bit more time.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrSbAvCC5iyx9XgdRgSQV-hWpmDGkujc/view?usp=sharing",
