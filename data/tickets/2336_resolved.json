Still waiting on the\r\npedalplate but it’s waiting for delivery.\r\n\r\nI was trying to get the VAM haptics to work in iracing, but no success so\r\nfar. They show as connected in the simsonn application and can test the\r\nrumble, but ingame I don’t feel them..\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\nDave\r\n\r\n",
