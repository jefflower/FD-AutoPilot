  "description_text": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI am currently in the market for a set of Plus X pedals with haptic\r\nfeedback.\r\nI am now wondering if there will be any extra import/customs fees.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to find an answer online, but cant find a conclusive\r\nanswer. Therefore i will ask the question directly!\r\n\r\nAre there any extra import or customs fees added after purchase on the\r\nwebsite? I am located in The Netherlands and the price for the product will\r\nbe around 254 dollar US.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nDaan Bergman\r\n\r\n",
