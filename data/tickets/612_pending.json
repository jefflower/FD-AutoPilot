  "description_text": "Hi! I want to order these as a gift for my husband but want to make sure that I am getting the right thing and everything that he needs to use them to their full potential. I have no idea what model pedals he has but just based on visual inspection I think he has the Pro Plus pedals. I’ve attached a photo so hopefully you can confirm that for me. If that’s the case, I’m looking at ordering the VAM Pro 3 pac set and a Plus X pedal control box. If he does in fact have the Pro Plus pedals is that what he would need to make them operate correctly? Is there anything else that he would need that I am missing? Thanks in advance for your help!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
