The software should enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → Firmware → Pedals → plusX.sfu and try updating the firmware manually. If the issue persists, we recommend installing Todesk (no registration required). Simply provide your ID and temporary access code, and we can schedule a time to assist you remotely. ",

Once Simsonn Manager indicates that it has entered firmware upgrade mode, you can release the button and follow the steps in the software to complete the recovery process.
