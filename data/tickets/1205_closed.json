If it appears green, it means the power is properly connected and the hardware is functioning correctly—you can proceed to test the vibration. Additionally, you can use SIMHUB version 9.9.3 for telemetry control, as it supports over 100 popular games. If you're unsure about the current status, feel free to send us a screenshot of the software interface, and I’ll help you verify the setup. ",
