I was using them last week and they were perfect. I bought pedals 1 month ago but I used them just 3-4 Hours. Thank you for the attention Luca -- Inviato da Libero Mail\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi luca. re1995@libero. it,    You can use SIMSONN Manager v2.1.3 to manually restore the PlusX firmware. Please follow the steps below:    Open SIMSONN Manager v2.1.3;    Press and hold the upgrade button on the PlusX control box, then plug the USB cable back in (keep holding the button);    Once the software shows it has entered firmware update (Flasher) mode, go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu, and complete the update;    After the update, unplug and replug both the USB cable and the power supply;    In SIMSONN Manager, check the firmware versions: CPU1: 2.0.6 / CPU2: 2.0.4. If they match, the restore was successful;    Finally, click the vibration test button and confirm the haptics/vibration works normally.",
