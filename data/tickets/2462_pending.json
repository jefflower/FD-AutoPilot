Due to stock shortages at our German\r\n> warehouse, we plan to wait until around the 11th for new goods to arrive at\r\n> the German warehouse before shipping your order. This will help avoid\r\n> customs duties. Since all previous shipments to Slovenia have been sent via\r\n> the German warehouse, we are unsure whether shipping directly from China\r\n> would result in unexpectedly high taxes. If you require the goods urgently,\r\n> we can arrange for UPS to ship them to you. Please let us know your\r\n> preference as soon as possible.\r\n>\r\n> If you have any questions, reply to this email or contact us at\r\n> service@simsonn.com\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMatic Lindič\r\n\r\n",
