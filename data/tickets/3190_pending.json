  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn,\r\n\r\nI was hoping you could connect me with the right contact.  My name is \r\nNeil Schneider.  In my earlier career, I ran Meant to be Seen which is \r\nwhere the founders of Oculus first met among other things. I also serve \r\nas Executive Director of The International Future Computing Association \r\n(TIFCA).\r\n\r\nI'm working with a team of content producers and industry experts to \r\ndevelop a new initiative to help grow the sales of simulators (e.g. sim \r\nracing, flight simulators, etc.) and the vendors that support them.  We \r\nbelieve the simulator market is underserved, and if certain \r\nopportunities are realized, vendors could benefit from stronger revenue \r\npotential and customer retention.\r\n\r\nExamples of products that could benefit from this effort include PC \r\ncomponents (e.g. CPU, GPU, motherboards, etc.), gaming peripherals (e.g. \r\nwheels, flight sticks, pedals), immersive devices (e.g. VR HMDs, \r\nhaptics), rigs, simulators, and more.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for the opportunity to share our ongoing research \r\nwith hopes that we can find opportunities to work together.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNeil\r\n-- \r\n**\r\n*Neil Schneider* / CEO\r\n*Meant to be Seen*\r\nneils@mtbs3D.com\r\n905.493.0896\r\nwww.mtbs3D.com <http://www.mtbs3D.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nThis email has been checked for viruses by Avast antivirus software.\r\nwww.avast.com\r\n",
