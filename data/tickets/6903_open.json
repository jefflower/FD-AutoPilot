  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nOn August 5th 2025 I ordered Simson Plus X pedals under order number\r\nSSN2239.\r\nYesterday a problem appeared with my throttle, when I drive suddenly my\r\nthrottle becomes stiff, and I have to press it really hard a couple of\r\ntimes to get it working again. At first I was thinking this is a one time\r\nthing, but it repeats again unexpectedly when I continue to use pedals.\r\nI was not able to determine why it happens but I'm suspecting of two things\r\nat the moment, it is either hydraulic damper or blue silicon roller which\r\nstops throttle movement at one point when pressed (picture attached).\r\nPlease if you already had some experience with this kind of problem I would\r\nappreciate your help, as when this happens It stops me from driving so I'm\r\nnot able to enjoy any competitive sim racing with other drivers until this\r\nis solved.\r\n\r\nBest regards!\r\nVlado\r\n\r\n",
