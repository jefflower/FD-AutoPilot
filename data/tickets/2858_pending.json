One added £1M to pipeline in 3 months. Another closed a £1.6M trade deal by adjusting how they handled buyers and calls.\r\n\r\nMost of it comes from making sales more simple and direct. \r\n\r\nIf is looking at growth this quarter, happy to show how we’d approach it.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBailey\r\n\r\nOn Thu, August 14, 2025 8:43 AM, Bailey Thomson <thomson@mycloserscode.site>\r\n[thomson@mycloserscode.site]> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hey\r\n> \r\n> Saw while scrolling through Google.
