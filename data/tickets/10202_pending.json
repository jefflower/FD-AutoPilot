  "description_text": "Hello - I’ve raised an issue with you regarding the haptic motors from my order ref: #SSN4242\r\n\r\nI’ve had a number of responses from you to try and diagnose the issue; however, I’ve not heard from you since 31st December.\r\n\r\nI’d really like to get this issue resolved. The pedals are excellent, and when the haptics worked, they were also very good. But I’ve not been able to use them since 26th December due to the issues I’ve experienced.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what else you need from me to get to a resolution.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n",

However today the patio motors seem to have lost almost all power. I can just about hear them when they activate, but there is not enough power from them to feel anything- quite the opposite to the great feedback they had been giving.  \n   \n I’ve power cycled them, tried a different usb port (always direct to PC, not via a hub).  \n   \n Can you advise how I should proceed? \n   \n Kind regards \n   \n Steven \n \n  On 1 Dec 2025, at 13:40, SIMSONN <service@simsonn.com> wrote:  \n \n \n  ﻿\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n         \n          \n  \n\n     \n      \n\n        \n          \n\n             \n\n              \n                \n\n                   \n                       \n                        SIMSONN\n                       \n                   \n\n                     \n                      \n                        \n\n                           \n                            \n                              Order #SSN4242\n                            \n                           \n                        \n                      \n\n                     \n                \n              \n\n\n             \n          \n        \n\n\n      \n     \n  \n\n\n\n          \n  \n\n     \n      \n        \n          \n\n             \n              \n             \n  \n    Thank you for your purchase!\n  \n \n             \n  \n    \n    \n          We're getting your order ready to be shipped.
