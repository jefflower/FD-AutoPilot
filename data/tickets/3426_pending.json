      "body_text": "Hi Ben Moody,    The white progress bar represents the raw data, and the Plus pedals currently do not have a zeroing function, so this white signal is not the one used directly by the game. The blue progress bar is the signal that is actually used by the game.  We recommend that after calibration, you set a 5% dead zone to ensure proper operation.  If you see a green line, you can use a wire to connect the main control box to any metal screw on the pedal, which helps stabilize the signal.  Please rest assured that your pedals are functioning correctly.",
