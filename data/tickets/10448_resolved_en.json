  "description_text": "Good morning.\n\nI recently bought your Plus X pedalboard with haptic motors. It's a great product and I'm very comfortable with both your software and simhub. The only problem I encountered is the failure of the motors with Le Mans Ultimate. I've tried in every way and with both software but I just can't get them to work. With the other simulators, however, I had no problem. Surely it's me who's doing something wrong, I kindly ask you for help to solve this problem.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest regards, Simone Ricci",
