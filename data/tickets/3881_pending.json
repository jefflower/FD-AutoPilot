      "body_text": "Hi Gaga Baroni,  Yes, this solution is quite simple. You just need to isolate the metal connection between the VAM Pro and its mounting bracket by using nylon screws and nylon washers. If you are unable to purchase these small washers locally, please provide your address, contact name, and phone number, and we will arrange to send you a set. ",
