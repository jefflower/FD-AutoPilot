I have attached the grounding cable and tried with all other usb\r\ndevices disconnected as well and this still has not fixed the issue. The\r\nonly way to fix it is to increase the strength of the effect over ~60%.\r\nHowever, I want to run the ABS effect at ~25% strength and 25Hz and this\r\ncauses huge interference in the brake input that makes the game undrivable\r\nwith the motor.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions to fix this?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNavin\r\n\r\n",
