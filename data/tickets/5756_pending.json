  "description_text": "Good evening, I'm writing to try to get some help with my plus x pedals and\r\nvram ffb motors.\r\nI ordered them a month ago, I received the pedals first then the motors. I\r\nattached the motors as directed and after a few days one of the motors\r\nstopped working. I sent it back and received a replacement. They worked\r\nfine for a couple minutes then the same motor on started to get weak and\r\nthen eventually stopped. I moved the plug to the left side which is\r\nnumber 3 and the motors work. Is there something I need to do to the\r\ncontrol box because now i see its the box and not the motor? Please help/ I\r\npurchased from amazon\r\n\r\nRespectfully and Sincerely Submitted\r\n\r\nDerrick Antonio Williams\r\nDaneTheGamer- Sim Racing Enthusiast\r\nAudio Engineer, Beat Programmer & Song Writer @ D.A.W MUSIC\r\n914-419-8096\r\n\r\nRespectfully and Sincerely Submitted\r\n\r\nDerrick Antonio Williams\r\nAudio Engineer, Beat Programmer & Song Writer @ D.A.W MUSIC\r\n914-419-8096\r\n\r\nRespectfully and Sincerely Submitted\r\n\r\nDerrick Antonio Williams\r\nAudio Engineer, Beat Programmer & Song Writer @ D.A.W MUSIC\r\n914-419-8096\r\n\r\n",
