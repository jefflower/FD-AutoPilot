  "description_text": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI recently bought a set of Simsonn Pro Pedals and have been trying to set them up. They both work on their own to an extent, meaning I can fully press the brake or throttle and get a 0-100 response from the pedal, but I have one key problem. When I am actuating the problem, my braking performance reduces, almost linearly, If I am at 100% throttle, pressing the brake pedal will give me almost no response at all, maybe 5-10%. If I am 50% throttle, I might get 50% out of my brake pedal when full pressed down. To be clear, this is not a physical limitation but all within game/software.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I have attached a picture of my setup. The control box is mounted underneath.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\n",
