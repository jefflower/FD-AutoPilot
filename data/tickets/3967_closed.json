  "description_text": "Hello, the Pro X Ultra pedal does not work. I installed it and did the\r\ninitial configuration. After 10 minutes of testing, I turned off the PC to\r\ndo other things. When I returned, it did not work! The application is\r\nblocked! The SIM Manager is not blocked. IRacing does not recognize the\r\npedal, and the SIM Messenger software is blocked, without the possibility\r\nof moving or configuring it. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. I tried\r\nthis process throughout the day and it did not work. I have a championship\r\non Sunday and I would like to use the Prodigy! I would like to know if you\r\nhave any explanation and how to make it work?\r\n\r\n",
