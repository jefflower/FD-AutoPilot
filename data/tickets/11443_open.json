  "description_text": "Hi I recently bought the Simsonn plus X pedals and the usb I plug into my\r\ncomputer seems to be shorting the circuit whenever plugged in, I bought an\r\nexternal hub with a power source and it still shorts that, it doesn’t even\r\nneed to be connected to the pedals to do it it will short even with nothing\r\nconnected, has this happen to people before, do I need a new cable?\r\n\r\n",
