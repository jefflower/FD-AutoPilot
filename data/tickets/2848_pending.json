  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn less than a month of using it just on weekends, it seems one of the\r\nvibration module is already broken. It can be detected in the simsonn\r\nmanager software but when clicking vibration button, the VAM does not\r\nvibrate. Other VAM modules are working fine. I remove the VAM module from\r\nthe pedals, and tried to shake them, i notice that there is a very\r\nnoticible clanking when shaking the defective VAM. I seem something loose\r\ninside. See attached video.\r\n\r\n",
