One last question, hopefully: If ordering\r\nthe pedals from your website, the Plus, not the Pro, will I need to also\r\norder the haptics control box or does each pedal set come with that\r\nstandard. It was not exactly clear from the notes on the product page.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your help!\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Nov 26, 2025 at 6:02 AM support@simsonn.com ",
