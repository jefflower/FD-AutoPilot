However, SimHub has already released version 9.9.3, which includes compatibility with our pedals, so they are now fully functional in supported games.  As for usage recommendations: In Speed mode, excessive travel or continuous rotation may lead to motor damage. We suggest setting a reasonable speed range and limiting the vibration intensity to around 50%, with a maximum of 70%. Also, try to avoid prolonged continuous operation to extend the motor’s lifespan.",
