  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI’m interested in purchasing the Plus X pedal set and would like to ask about VAT handling for deliveries to Austria. Is VAT already included at checkout, or will I need to pay it separately upon delivery? I’d appreciate some clarification to better understand the full cost before ordering.\r\n\r\nAlso, while browsing the product page, I noticed a small typo in Section 2 – Shipping Choices, in the table. The word \"weight\" appears to be misspelled as \"weiht\". Just wanted to bring this to your attention in case you’d like to correct it.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help, and I’m looking forward to your response!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDiart Tahiri\r\n\r\n",
