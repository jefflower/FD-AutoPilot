      "body_text": "Hi David García Ros,     The main difference between ProX and ProX Ultra lies in motor support and functionality:    ProX Ultra supports VAM Pro motors, allowing bidirectional movement.    ProX only supports unidirectional motor movement.    As for PlusX, ProX, and Ultra, they all share the following features:    16-bit high-resolution precision for accurate control;    RGB telemetry lighting for real-time status display;    8-level hydraulic fine-tuning to meet different preferences.    If you don’t have high requirements for lighting, PlusX is also a great choice. No matter which model you choose, these pedals will deliver an excellent experience.",
