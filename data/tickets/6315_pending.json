  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nFirst of all I want to say that I and both my friends are very happy with\r\nour new Simsonn Plus X pedals and the haptics. They look and feel great and\r\nwe are already noticing improvements in our sim racing performance with\r\njust a few days of use.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game that we play most is Le Mans Ultimate and the Simsonn\r\nsoftware shows a message that \"Telemetry is not connected\". This makes the\r\nhaptics to not work properly with your software. We are now relying in a\r\nthird party software, SimHiub, to get the correct inputs for the haptics.\r\nSoftware is a very important part of the sim racing gear and I hope you can\r\nfix this soon (SimHub is not always a stable software).\r\n\r\nI also will leave soon a review at your site.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJoão Oliveira\r\n\r\n",

Due to the sheer volume of simulation racing games available, our engineers must manually gather data from each title individually. This represents a substantial workload, necessitating a step-by-step approach to refinement. In the meantime, you may utilise Simhub for haptics control. We appreciate your feedback and comments!",
