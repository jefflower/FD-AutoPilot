After waiting for a few mintues, I select the program to turn it on and it's asking to download the update again.  Is their a way to manually update or can you send me a link to download the update and install?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJames Waring\r\n\r\n",

If it's not a Pro X pedal, we'll replace it with a Plus X control box and refund the difference since they work the same for pedals other than the Pro X.  Since we don't plan on selling the Pro X Ultra box separately, we don't have a packaging solution for it, so choosing the Plus X box will make it easier for us to ship it in one package with the VAM Pro Set.",
