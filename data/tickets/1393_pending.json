  "description_text": "Hello, I am trying to set up a new set of Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedals. They are plugged into the Simsonn control box, and that is plugged into my PC via USB. The RGB lights all came on when I connect to the PC. When I try to run the Simsonn manager software, it says the pedals are disconnected and I cannot get any of them to calibrate or read any signal. Please advise how to get this working. Thank you!\r\n",
