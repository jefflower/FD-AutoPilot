  "description_text": "Dear SimSonn Team,\r\nI hope this message finds you well.\r\nMy name is Fabien, and I’m the Buyer & Head of SimRacing at Cybertek, a leading French IT reseller specializing in high-performance systems and gaming solutions.\r\nWe’ve recently strengthened our presence in the sim racing space by becoming the official partner of Alpine Sim Racing, supplying their professional-grade simulators with our custom-built gaming PCs.\r\nYou can see examples of this collaboration featured on our socials, Alpine F1’s official site<https://www.alpinef1.com/news/alpine-sim-racing-announces-partnership-with-groupe-cybertek?utm_source=chatgpt.com>, and Alpine’s media portal<https://media.alpinecars.com/?p=479576&utm_source=chatgpt.com>.\r\nGiven your excellent reputation in the sim racing community for offering premium-grade pedals and components at competitive prices, I’d love to explore a distribution partnership between SimSonn and Cybertek for the French market.\r\nHere are a few formats we’re considering:\r\n\r\n  *   Introducing SimSonn products to our national B2B/B2C catalog, with strategic promotion via our website, physical stores, and showrooms.\r\n  *   Bundled solutions: integrating SimSonn hardware into our turnkey SimRacing rigs, especially for partners like Alpine.\r\n  *   Events & demo setups: organizing in-person demos and open house days to showcase your gear to racing fans across France.\r\n  *   Technical & marketing collaboration: co-creating content (tutorials, video reviews, streaming) to boost visibility and adoption.\r\nTo move forward, I would appreciate it if you could share:\r\n\r\n  1.  Your full product catalog, pricing, and reseller margin conditions for France.\r\n  2.  Any exclusivity or territory limitations you might have for distribution.\r\n  3.  Interest in co-hosting events or activations in France (especially alongside Alpine or our showroom presence).\r\nWe strongly believe SimSonn and Cybertek share a common vision: making high-end sim racing gear more accessible, while maintaining excellence in performance and support.\r\nA collaboration could benefit both our communities and strengthen our brands in the European market.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time – I would be happy to discuss further via video call or meet in person if you be traveling to France in the near future.\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\r\nWarm regards,\r\nFabien Lacaule\r\nBuyer\r\n(+33) 07 88 11 72 21\r\n\r\n[cid:image001.png@01DBE751.6E3E1050]\r\n130, rue Achard - Bât.
