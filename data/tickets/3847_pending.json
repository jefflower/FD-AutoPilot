  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently ordered a set of Plus X H3-P3 sim racing pedals along with 3 VAM\r\nPro Haptic Reactors. The order was scheduled to arrive together on\r\nSeptember 12th under FedEx tracking ID *884181766070*.\r\n\r\nOnly the boxes containing the pedals and baseplate were delivered. The box\r\nwith the haptic reactors never arrived. I’ve attached a screenshot of the\r\nFEDEX delivery confirmation page, which confirms only the pedals/baseplate\r\nboxes were delivered via courier photo.\r\n\r\nCould you please assist in locating and sending the missing items?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your help\r\n-- \r\nEthan Gorz\r\n312 720 2113\r\nethangorz.com\r\n\r\n",
