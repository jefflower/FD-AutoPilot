  "description_text": "I have now directly talked 5 people that I know out of ever purchasing from Simsonn. They will share with others. I have talked to another handful on Reddit on forums mentioning your company’s name. Those posts will stay up as long as my review stays up on your site.\n\nMy 5 star review on your site has already cost you more business than it will ever help. I will never get bored of this. It’s about principle. Letting people know how dishonest and fraudulent your company is will become a routine part of my life, like eating and sleeping.\n\nThis could all stop so easily. But it could all continue just as easily as well. Keep in mind, from the beginning I have never asked you for anything but to honor the initial discount you offered me (which we’re way past being acceptable) and to remove my review from your site.\n\nYou’re welcome to play hardball all you like. It’s now cost you at least 5 times more than it cost me. That multiplier will only grow. I stand to lose no more money. Your losses from this will continue to grow.\n\nRemember, I’m not the one who sent a misleading email about a discount code. I’m not the one who lied and said a review is impossible to take down, and then removed negative reviews swiftly and easily. I’m not the one who is wrong. I’m not the one losing sales over this. I am the one simply reacting to the way you have handled all this. I am the one who took pictures of every part of this to prove it.\n\nDan Wells\n\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS.\r\n",
