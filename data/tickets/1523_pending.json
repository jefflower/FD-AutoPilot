First, please use the Offset function in the SIMSONN Manager software to perform an initial calibration of the pedals. If you purchased the complete PlusX set (including the controller and pedals), we’ve already calibrated it before shipping. However, if you bought the controller or pedals separately, a manual calibration is required.  Also, make sure to connect the device directly to a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC. We do not recommend using USB hubs, as some of them may have unstable power supply, which can cause communication issues.  Please provide your order number so I can check your purchase details. All our products are fully tested before shipment, so it's rare for any issue to occur upon delivery.  If your video exceeds 20MB, I won’t be able to receive it directly. Please upload it to Google Drive or another cloud service and share the link with us for further analysis. Don’t worry—if there’s any issue, we will help resolve it promptly.",
