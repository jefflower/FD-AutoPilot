  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Team,\r\nI’m interested in ordering the Simsonn Pro X Ultra Sim Racing Pedals with Haptic Reactor (with Baseplate), but I have a few questions before completing my checkout.\r\n\r\n  1.\r\nI’m located in Iraq, and I see Iraq listed as an available shipping destination on your checkout page. Could you please confirm that you can ship directly to Iraq (specifically to Baghdad or other major cities)?\r\n  2.\r\nThe checkout system shows a shipping cost of $17.90 (Concessionary Shipping, 10-18 days). However, according to your site, the Pro X Ultra with baseplate weighs around 12 kg, which would normally fall into the “>6 kg” category.\r\n     *\r\nCould you please confirm whether the $17.90 shipping fee applies for this product to Iraq, or if additional shipping charges may be required due to its weight?\r\n  3.\r\nWhich courier service do you use for deliveries to Iraq (e.g., DHL, UPS, EMS, etc.)?\r\n  4.\r\nAre there any customs duties, import taxes, or clearance fees that I should expect to pay upon arrival, or is everything covered in the order total?\r\n  5.\r\nIf direct shipping to Iraq isn’t fully supported, do you recommend a forwarding option or partner courier that can reliably handle delivery to Iraq?\r\n\r\nI’d like to confirm these details before placing my order to ensure smooth delivery.\r\nThank you very much for your help and clarification.\r\nBest regards,\r\n[Hussein Firas]\r\n[Baghdad, Iraq]\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We can indeed ship to Iraq, including Baghdad and other major cities. However, please note that the shipping cost is quite high — currently, we can only ship via FedEx or DHL, with an estimated delivery time of 3–7 days. Because of this, we have removed the “Concessionary Shipping” option from our checkout system.  You may be charged customs duties or clearance fees upon arrival, though in most cases the chances are low.You can let us know the declared value you prefer, and we can adjust it accordingly for your shipment.
