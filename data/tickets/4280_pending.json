After that, reinsert the USB and test whether the RX axis has been successfully disabled.      Additionally, for the white raw signal, you can use the Offset function to zero it out and set a 5% deadzone. This will not affect the blue signal, which is the one used by the game.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdSWa1bxmbPksj9Hlzuo8bl7_bM8ixr/view?usp=drive_link",
