      "body_text": "Hi Gary Douglas,    Please provide your order number and a photo showing the installation. Also, confirm whether the software version is SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0. Regarding VAM force, it is not recommended to set it too high. We limit the maximum force based on the type of pedals to prevent damage to the VAM, while VAM Pro has no such limitation.  If the vibration does not stop, it may be caused by unstable USB power or EMI interference from the wheelbase, which can prevent the stop signal from reaching the motor. Please let us know your wheelbase brand, and we will provide a specific solution.     This issue is caused by EMI interference from the wheelbase. Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve it. Most customers with similar setups (such as Fanatec, MOZA, and T500 users) have resolved the problem using this method.     To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

Navigate to the pedals-firmware folder → pedals folder → and select the plusx.sfu file to perform the update.  After the update, run a test to check whether the issue occurs with just one motor showing reduced vibration strength, or if all three motors are affected. We recommend setting the vibration frequency between 10Hz–30Hz.  If stronger vibration intensity is required, you may consider upgrading to VAM Pro motors, as they are designed to deliver significantly higher vibration force.",
