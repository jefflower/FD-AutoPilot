  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a set of PRO X pedals I purchased earlier this year.  I have\r\nupgraded them with your new VAM Pro haptic reactors.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have read, all I have to do is update the firmware on the ProX\r\ncontrol box.  I don't see anything within the Simsonn Manager software to\r\nperform this firmware update.  Nor do I see anything on your website with\r\ninstructions on this.\r\n\r\nI cannot get the haptic reactors to function, none of the three\r\ncurrently function.  So, I assume my control box is still not updated\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nDo you have an instruction guide on how to perform this update?  Or do I\r\nhave to purchase a new control box?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nJeff Miller\r\njm112583@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

In the software, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update, then select the file pedals-firmware-pedals-prox.sfu. Once the update is complete, the VAM Pro will work properly.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdSWa1bxmbPksj9Hlzuo8bl7_bM8ixr/view?usp=drive_link",
