  "description_text": "Hello, I'm planning to buy the Simsonn Plus X P2-H2. They cost  $169.00 and\r\nthe shipping cost for my location in France is $9.90. That brings the total\r\nto $178.90 or 154.11€.\r\nIf I understand correctly what is said in your help section, for an order\r\nvalue less than 150€ shipped in the EU, there is no additional customs\r\nfees.\r\nAs such, do you think it would be possible to get a 5% discount code, or\r\none that brings the order value just below 150€ to avoid potential\r\nadditional fees?\r\n\r\n",
