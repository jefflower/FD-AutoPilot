  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n     My name is Daniel Gavrich. I just recently ordered and received the\r\nSIMSONN plus X Pedals. (Plus X-P3-H3-Plate)\r\n\r\n     My purchase was through amazon. However the clutch pedal never seemed\r\nto work since i got it, i realized today that the wire was split where the\r\nconnectivity goes. I assume this is from Shipping etc, I’ve had them for\r\nless than a month (July 6th) i can return the entire set up through amazon,\r\nhowever i’m very interested in just a replacement clutch pedal is this\r\npossible??\r\nThank you for your time and response in advance. If you need further\r\ninformation please let me know.\r\n\r\n",
