      "body_text": "Hi Mirko Parente,    There are a few common reasons for disconnection:     First, if your computer uses a 2-prong power plug instead of a 3-prong grounded plug, electromagnetic interference from the wheelbase may not be properly discharged, which can cause instability in connected USB devices.     Second, if you’re using a USB hub without independent power supply, please avoid doing so. We recommend connecting the device directly to the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC for stable power and data transmission.     In our testing environment, the PlusX control box and motor remain consistently connected, even after several days of inactivity, without any disconnection issues.",
