  "description_text": "Hi my names Tommy (845-518-2111). I Havent received any new notifications\r\nfor Haptic Shipping Info in a while its been close to 2 weeks now , please\r\nlet me know whats going on with that . i live in New York about an hour\r\nabove NYC , Im in the process of starting a Sim lounge in my area. I bought\r\nyour Proplus pedals when the curved plates came out last year . They were\r\ngreat for a first set as i built my own Sim Rig Chassis from scratch , I'm\r\na master technician , Amateur fabricator . I just received the New X pedals\r\nand they are GREAT! much has improved . not everything is perfect but\r\nthey're getting there . I like the Hydraulic dampener on the brake pedal ,\r\nonly thing i can say is the better quality dampeners work better when\r\nreally fine tuning things , If you guys could come up with that style\r\ndampener for the gas pedal that works in compression nd rebound that would\r\nbe Ideal and a higher quality dampener with more adjustability for the\r\nBrake pedal , The dampener on the gas pedal is redundant , no gas pedal\r\nfeels that heavy  . I use the light Spring that comes in the kit an NO\r\ndampener on the Gas pedal and the Brake pedal Dampener set relatively low\r\nso it doesn't slow down the pedal too much and spike the pressure then fall\r\noff , and i use the bare steel bottom spring, one yellow ,short 1 med blue\r\nand one long blue elastomer , i mostly like driving Gt3 , LMDH , LMP cars\r\n. Overall im really impressed with the new design and the rgb lights are\r\ngreat too!\r\n\r\nOnce i get the haptics , ill do a full review on my youtube page . i want\r\nto use as much of your products in my Sim lounge as possible , My guess\r\nright now , most likely id out in an order of 4 X pedal sets w haptics  , 4\r\nh shifters , 2 sequential shifters , 4 steering wheel button boxes , 2-3\r\ndirect drive wheelbases , 2-4 button boxes . etc  So id love to open up a\r\nline of communication with someone there at Simsonn . thank you guys very\r\nmuch for your time and hard work to make this Sport what its evolving into\r\ntoday .\r\n\r\n",
