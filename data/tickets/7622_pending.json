We recently inquired with logistics providers on your behalf, but all quotes were prohibitively expensive, with the lowest option costing approximately $166 USD. To break even, we would need you to cover an additional shipping fee of about $40 USD. Alternatively, we can hold your shipment until mid-December when shipping rates are expected to decrease. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
