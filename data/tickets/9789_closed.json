  "description_text": "*Dear Simsonn Support Team,*\r\n\r\nI am writing regarding my order *#SSN5176*, which was delivered today,\r\nJanuary 2nd, 2026.\r\nI ordered and paid an additional *€6.78 for 2x U-shaped mounting brackets* to\r\nmount the motors horizontally. These were not included in the package.\r\nInstead, I received *1x Z-shaped bracket *and* 2**x L-shaped brackets*,\r\nwhich are included in the VAM Pro set.\r\n\r\nIn my order notes, I mentioned the removal of the standard Z and L brackets\r\nfrom the order to avoid paying for parts I didn't need. It appears there\r\nwas a misunderstanding. The Z and L brackets were included anyway, but\r\nthe *U-shaped\r\nbrackets I paid for are missing.*\r\n\r\nAs I did not receive the U-shaped brackets, I would like you to:\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   Ship the *2x U-shaped mounting brackets* that were missing from my order.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   Or, if shipping is not possible, please *refund the €6.78* I paid for\r\n   the brackets so I can source them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSamuel\r\n[image: IMG_20260102_112422.jpg]\r\n[image: IMG_20260102_112447.jpg]\r\n\r\n",
