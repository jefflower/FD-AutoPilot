  "description_text": "hi there, i just bought a set of plus x pedals, but how can i safely mount\r\nthe pedal baseplate to my sim rig's pedal plate? The screw holes don't line\r\nup, and I can drill new holes if I need to, but the plates don't sit flush\r\nbecause the nuts are in the way... I was thinking maybe drill new holes in\r\nthe 4 corners, and use the plastic rings included for the brake pedal as\r\nspacers to lift the nuts off of the black plate? Any other ideas? Thanks\r\n\r\n",

I think this is probably the best\r\nsolution. The biggest weakness now is the cheap rig ?\r\n\r\n",
