I still haven’t received my package. I was told that I will be getting a refund for my shipping costs and am still to hear back from or receive this. \r\n\r\nI would like to know where my package is. When it will be delivered. And when I will get my refund for my shipping costs as the express shipping has not been met in any way. \r\n",
