Two shipments destined for our German warehouse were impacted by heavy snowfall in Europe, causing road blockages and delivery delays. We have already arranged for shipments from China. Should any customs duties arise, we will reimburse you.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, 13 Jan at 2:49 PM , andrea bartoli <andreabar88@hotmail.it> wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nHave you shipped my order?\r\nOrde SSN5834\r\nOn ups tracking appear “label created” from 07/01/26 but not shipped..\r\nBest regards\r\nAndrea Bartoli\r\n\r\nIl giorno 7 gen 2026, alle ore 15:40, support@simsonn.com ha scritto:\r\n\r\n﻿\r\nHi andrea bartoli,\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.
