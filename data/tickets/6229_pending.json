I previously initiated a return and provided the tracking number\r\nas requested. According to the carrier’s tracking information, the return\r\npackage was delivered on *[9-23-2025]* (proof of delivery is attached).\r\n\r\nSince then, I have not received any updates. I reached out again last month\r\nrequesting a status update, but I have not received a response.\r\n\r\nThe return shipment cost me over $100, and I would appreciate an update on\r\nthe status of my refund as soon as possible. Please confirm that the\r\nreturned items have been received and let me know when I can expect the\r\nrefund to be processed.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nML\r\n\r\n",
