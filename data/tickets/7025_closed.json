  "description_text": "After purchasing my *SIMSONN PRO pedals* from AliExpress, I did not use\r\nthem for a period of time and only began using them recently. I\r\ninstalled *software\r\nversion 2.1.2* from the official website and ran it. However, when I\r\nconnected the pedals via USB, a message saying *“Old Version”* appeared,\r\nand the software began to lag intermittently.\r\n\r\nUpdating the firmware did not solve the problem. In some cases, the device\r\nwas briefly recognized, but it did not function properly. The axes were\r\nstill not detected, and the program continued to freeze and disconnect\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\nNext, I downloaded and ran *SimPedalsConfig_V4*, but when the pedals were\r\nconnected, the program continuously showed *“Not Responding.”* When the\r\npedals were not connected, this issue did not occur, so I could not proceed\r\nwith the setup.\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried connecting the pedals using *FreeJoy*. The device was\r\nrecognized as *“Simsonn 1.7.1,”* but in all cases, the axes still did not\r\nfunction at all.\r\n\r\nAs a student, I do not have the financial ability to spend a large amount\r\nof money, which is why I chose to purchase these pedals. Unfortunately, the\r\nproduct not functioning as expected has been very disappointing to me. I\r\nsincerely ask for your assistance in resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n(The grounding has been done correctly.)\r\n(Please let me know if you need any additional information or photos to\r\nhelp troubleshoot this problem.)\r\n\r\n",
