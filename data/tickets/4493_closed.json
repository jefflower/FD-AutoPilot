  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support Team,\r\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on my order\r\nSSN2784, which I have already inquired about multiple times over the past\r\nweek. This is now the fourth email I’ve sent, and I have yet to receive any\r\nresponse.\r\nCould you please let me know where my order is and provide an update as\r\nsoon as possible? I would appreciate a prompt reply, as the delay and lack\r\nof communication are becoming very frustrating.\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from\r\nyou soon.\r\nBest regard Cristian Pezzotti\r\n\r\n",
