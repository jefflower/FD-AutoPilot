Being 100% honest I'm between y'all (Plus X model,\r\nnewest one) and Simagic P1000's. Reading/watching reviews I've seen your\r\ncustomer service is awesome which is a super plus.\r\n\r\nI'm located in Puerto Rico so I wanted to ask what are typical delivery\r\ntimes and shipping costs?\r\nI'm guessing the warranty covers me, so if something needs servicing or\r\nparts I'm good, correct?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGabriel\r\n\r\n",

However, shipping to Puerto Rico will incur additional shipping fees. Based on the previous address, the estimated cost is around $35 USD.
