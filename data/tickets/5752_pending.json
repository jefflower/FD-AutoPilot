      "body_text": "Hi Imran,     If you feel that the clutch pedal’s return force is too light, you can replace the spring with the blue or red clutch spring included in the accessory kit.  These springs provide stronger resistance to overcome the dual-direction damping of the hydraulic damper.     We don’t use gas springs, because in essence, a gas spring behaves like two springs stacked together, which doesn’t provide a realistic clutch feel.  In fact, using our yellow, blue, or red mechanical springs alone is sufficient.  The hydraulic damper in our system is designed to absorb the force during both pressing and release, offering a realistic hydraulic sensation, smoother motion, and improved pedal travel stability and muscle memory.",
