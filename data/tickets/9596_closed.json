  "description_text": "Hi, I purchased a handbrake from you on aliexpress. Order number 3066003737970306.\r\n\r\nIt was for a  handbrake that doesn’t work and has major calibration issues.\r\n\r\nYou can see the videos linked in this mail.\r\n\r\nCan you help me ? I tried everything with the preload and the calibration from Windows. Nothing works.\r\n\r\nWaiting for your help.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMaxime Soubras\r\n\r\n",

But when I launch a game and I pull it to 100% it’s only going to like 50%, if I leave the game and come back, it’s ok, if I do it again it’s not ok.\r\nYou can see in the 2 videos I’ve sent before. It’s like the calibration is always changing so I don’t understand that.\r\nDo you have a picture of what I have to do ? Put a simple cable from the handbrake to the PC like that ?\r\nGoogle image to show if I have to do that :\r\n\r\n[image]\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMaxime\r\n\r\nLe 1 janv. 2026 à 16:37, service@simsonn.com a écrit :\r\n\r\n﻿\r\nHi Maxime Soubras,\r\n\r\nI see that the calibration is complete.
