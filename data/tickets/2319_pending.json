      "body_text": "Hi Dean Merchant,   Are you sure that using your friend’s ProX Ultra control box resolves the issue? Please use the VKB tool to check whether four axes are detected. If yes, update your software to version 2.1.0 and flash the plusxultra.sfu firmware. After that, please provide a VKB screenshot so we can confirm if the issue has been resolved. If it is still not resolved, we will arrange to send you a replacement control box. ",
