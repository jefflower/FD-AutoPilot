  "description_text": "Dear Simmson Team,\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holiday period, I attempted to purchase one of your\r\nproducts while a promotional discount was available. Unfortunately, due to\r\nan issue with my bank, I was unable to complete the payment process.\r\n\r\nI am now interested in finalizing the purchase; however, the discount is no\r\nlonger active.\r\nI am therefore writing to kindly ask whether it would be possible to apply\r\nthe same discount to this purchase, considering that the issue was beyond\r\nmy control.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and availability. I look forward to your\r\nkind response.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMatteo\r\n\r\n",
