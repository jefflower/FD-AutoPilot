  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nThank you for your message.\r\n\r\nAs requested, I have attached screenshots showing the issue I am currently\r\nencountering. According to my affiliate dashboard, my account status\r\ndisplays the message: “Your account is blocked! You will no longer receive\r\ncredit for your referrals.” As a result, I am unable to access my referral\r\nlink or coupon code (please see the attached images for reference).\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to kindly clarify that this issue was very likely caused by\r\nunauthorized login attempts from different locations. I believe my account\r\nmay have been targeted by a hacker who repeatedly attempted to access it,\r\nwhich then triggered GOAFFPRO’s automatic security system. Consequently,\r\nall related affiliate projects were temporarily locked as a security\r\nmeasure to protect my funds and prevent any unauthorized changes to my\r\nPayPal payment information.\r\n\r\nAfter contacting several of my affiliate partners, some of them have\r\nalready reviewed the situation and were willing to verify and unlock my\r\naffiliate accounts. I have also attached screenshots of these confirmations\r\nas additional reference. This gives me confidence that the issue was\r\nsecurity-related rather than due to any intentional violation of platform\r\nrules.\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n[image: image.png][image: image.png][image: image.png]\r\n\r\n[image: image.png][image: image.png][image: image.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[image: image.png][image: image.png][image: image.png]\r\nI truly hope you can understand my situation and kindly assist in reviewing\r\nand reopening my Simsonn affiliate account. I am fully committed to\r\ncomplying with all GOAFFPRO and Simsonn affiliate policies and am more than\r\nhappy to provide any further information or verification if needed.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time, understanding, and support.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTony Pham\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVào Thứ 2, 22 thg 12, 2025 vào lúc 21:41 service@simsonn.com <\r\nservice@simsonn.com> đã viết:\r\n\r\n> Hi TONY PHAM,\r\n>\r\n> Could you please take a screenshot of the issue you encountered so that we\r\n> can check the cause?\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> On Fri, 19 Dec at 7:40 AM , TONY PHAM <phamngocthuan16@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n> Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n> I am currently experiencing an issue where my account appears to be locked\r\n> (please see the attached file).\r\n> [image: image.png]\r\n>\r\n>  My affiliate ID is *7134626*, and my referral link is:\r\n> https://www.simsonn.com/?ref=TONYPHAM.\r\n> I have not received any notification from your team or from GoAffPro\r\n> regarding this issue via email.
