  "description_text": "Ive grounded the control box to the pc and to each pedal. The wall outlet\r\nis a grounded 3 prong outlet. The ac box supplied by you guys is a 2 prong\r\noutlet plug. But the issue im getting is with either the control box itself\r\nor the simsonn manager as the program is staying functional but the pedals\r\nare getting frozen in the software but work just fine in game but the\r\nsoftware gets stucks and makes the haptics get stuck on. Is there a way to\r\nwipe my control box and install/delete all simsonn manager files on my pc\r\nand start fresh again?\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Dalton Uhl,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     If you need to manually restore the firmware, please follow the steps below. Make sure to select the .sfu firmware file that matches your specific pedal model.      Please follow the steps below:    Press and hold the upgrade button on the PlusX main controller, then reconnect the USB cable.    Open SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 and check if it has entered recovery mode.    If recovery mode is detected, go to Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.    After the update is complete, test the device to see if it has been restored successfully.",
