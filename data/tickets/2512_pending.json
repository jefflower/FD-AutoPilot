  "description_text": "Greetings\r\n\r\nI hope you’re doing well. I recently ordered a set of Simsonn pedals (Order\r\n#SSN2054) and received confirmation that my order was shipped. However,\r\nwhen I check the USPS tracking information, it has been showing “In\r\nTransit” with no updates since July 30.\r\n\r\nI’m concerned the package may have been lost in transit. Could you please\r\ncheck on the status of the shipment and let me know the next steps?  I’m\r\nreally looking forward to receiving the pedals, so I hope we can resolve\r\nthis quickly.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexander I. Sanchez Perez\r\n\r\n",
