According to the manual, using 3 red dampers provides the longest travel and the softest feel. Of course, we recommend testing it with your foot to better evaluate the actual force feedback.  Our damper combinations have been carefully tested and optimized. You can also set your desired brake force range in the software—for example, 30 to 40 kg—to match your preferred driving feel.",

Most customers with similar setups (such as Fanatec, MOZA, and T500 users) have resolved the problem using this method.     To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

      "body_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nI tested by connecting the pedals alone and switching off the wheelbase.\r\nEven with the base and wheel switched off, the interference was there, so\r\nit is purely caused by the pedals alone. Regarding the recommended fixes:\r\n  1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a\r\nthree-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide\r\ngrounding.\r\nThis is not possible since I live in Estonia and we use the regular EU\r\noutlets.\r\n    2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the\r\nmetal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any\r\nmetal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and\r\nconductive.\r\nThere is paint on the black Simsonn Plus X pedal that the grounding wire is\r\nattached to. Otherwise it is grounded as shown in the picture i sent in my\r\nprevious email.\r\n    3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to\r\nconnect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground\r\nto discharge static buildup.\r\nThis is not possible, since I use a laptop as stated in my previous email.\r\nThe base is attached to a metal wheelstand though and after every time i\r\nuse it, i fold it and put it away. Mobility is important.\r\n    4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from\r\nhigh-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where\r\npossible.\r\n    5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB\r\n3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.\r\nTested both, by connecting to USB 3.0 ports directly and to a unpowered USB\r\nHUB. Interference is still there.\r\n    6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to\r\nhigh-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency\r\ninterference.\r\nThe USB cables that came with Simsonn pedals and Simagic wheelbase, both\r\nhave ferrite cores attached to them.\r\n    7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and\r\nfirmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI\r\nhandling improvements.\r\nSimsonn software and firmware are updated.\r\n    8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue,\r\nusing a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power\r\nand data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.\r\n\r\nI am getting really frustrated. Are there any other fixes or where can I\r\nfind the refund policy?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKontakt service@simsonn.com (",

It should help you resolve the problem physically in a simple way.             Also, please use SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1 (download link below):  ? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link    Please follow the steps below:    Open SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1;    Click Revert on the interface;    Then click Save;    Finally, replug the USB cable, wait for the system to recognize the device, and then test the pedals again.    This process will reset the configuration and resolve potential signal issues.",
