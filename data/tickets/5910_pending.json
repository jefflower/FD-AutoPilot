Sometimes they just\r\ndisconnect which has impacted a race before (Braking zone, I brake and they\r\ndisconnected for a slight second.)\r\n\r\nI have installed the firmware fully onto the pedals, I made sure the pedals\r\nare plugged into a Blue USB 3.0 port on my motherboard. I don't know what\r\nelse to do. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nWayne English\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Stealthy Cifer,   If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.          https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
