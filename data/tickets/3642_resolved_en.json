  "description_text": "Hello, I believe I’m having issues with the adjustable hydraulic brake rod that came with my pro X ultra pedals. I haven’t used them for about a week and after going to play I noticed a click when braking. After further testing and inspection it is the adjustable brake rod. I have it removed for now but it seems to have lost the smooth feel it once had, it will click upon initial braking and click repeatedly if you stop and continue applying pressure. Is there anyway to fix this?\n\nGet Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>",

During installation, a small amount of pressure needs to be applied to the hydraulic damper before tightening the mounting screws for optimal performance.
