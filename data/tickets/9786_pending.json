I am fully aware that it will take\r\nlonger than expected because of the holidays and I am still waiting on the\r\nrig so it does not matter, but would there be any chance that I can get an\r\nestimated arrival date? I would need to organize for someone to be home to\r\nreceive it.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nNoah Dekeyser\r\n\r\n",
