  "description_text": "keeping your list free of bots and bounces \r\n a clean list means higher open rates, stronger conversion rates, better inbox placement, and a lower Seguno price... it's a win, win. \r\n ​ \r\n Automatic bounce cleaning \r\n Seguno watches for both hard and soft bounces and unsubscribes email addresses that are hurting your deliverability. ​ A hard bounce (invalid email address) is unsubscribed the first time it happens. A soft bounce (mail box is full, recipients email server is down, etc)is unsubscribed after five consecutive soft bounces. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Deliverability monitoring \r\n Deliverability monitoring helps to keep your emails in the inbox (and out of the spam folder). Seguno keeps an eye on your email performance and if we start to see your performance drop, our team will reach out to help. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Industry updates and support \r\n Email rules and regulations are always evolving. To ensure your emails end up in the inbox, you'll be notified and supported on how to adjust when needed. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Have more questions? Contact Support\r\n",
