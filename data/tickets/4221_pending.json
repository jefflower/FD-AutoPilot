      "body_text": "Hi metallicafan2488,    First, if the SimHub connection is unstable, please make sure to use the USB 3.0 (blue) port on the back of your PC. USB 2.0 may not provide sufficient power, which can cause unstable connections.     Next, uninstall the old software from your PC and install the new 2.1.1 version from the link.  In the software, go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu to complete the firmware update.     After the update, your VAM Pro should work properly.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
