When replacing the control box, it’s necessary to reset the factory dead-zone position; otherwise, the signal might not be detected. Also, since your brake worked when plugged into the clutch port earlier, it indicates that the brake itself is fine, and a brand-new control box is very unlikely to be faulty. This means it’s most likely that the offset hasn’t been set, or there’s an installation issue with the brake.  Please send me photos of the brake pedal from the side and all around, as well as of the control box, so I can check. Normally, the calibration process shouldn’t be this troublesome.",
