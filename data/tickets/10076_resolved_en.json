The actual issue I'm having is that gears 1-2-5-6-7-Reverse are not engaging/showing up in the game. The games are not detecting any selection, however, gears 3-4 and the S1/S2 buttons are registering. I have provided a few images to show the steps I am going through.\n\nThanks\n\nGet Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>",
