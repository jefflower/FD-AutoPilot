  "description_text": "Hello,\n\nI recently purchased the Plus X pedals, and they have been very rough to\nuse. They constantly disconnect from my PC, and certain games don't even\npick up the signals. I have tried using the Simsonn manager and even\nfreejoy but both don't fix the Issue. I would like to refund the pedals\nplease. Let me know what the next steps are to make the return.\n\nOrder number is #SSN3597\n\nThank you.",

If this problem occurs, it indicates that your PC might not be properly grounded—for example, the power plug may not be connected to a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the PC case to the pedal frame, and also connect the main control box to the metal screws of the pedals. This will effectively resolve the disconnection issue.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
