  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI ended up purchasing your pattern 6+R H pattern shifter from amazon\r\n~6months ago before realizing you had a full product suite/website. It has\r\nbeen a blast to use, but when I upgraded to my new PC a few days ago all my\r\nperipherals work except this shifter. The led buttons are dim and when\r\npressed don't glow bright blue like before. I can still see the white power\r\ninside the device.\r\n\r\nIm running a booster cable to the PC and have tried different usb slots,\r\nanother computer and direct USB hub power. It is recognized in my device\r\nmanager but on Asseta Corsa it can recognize all gears except 3rd and 5th\r\ngear.\r\n\r\nIs there any firmware updates for this device or troubleshooting I can try?\r\nTo me it seems like its not getting enough power but I have tried all I can\r\nwith no luck. I very much like this shifter so I am trying to find a\r\nsolution. A warranty was purchased through amazon but since the purchase I\r\nhad a falling out with them and have closed my account down due to shady\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n",
