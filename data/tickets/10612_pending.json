  "description_text": " I'm loving the Plus X pedals I ordered through your amazon store (Order\r\n#111-4262441-6949060) My sim rig came with a baseplate. So I don't need the\r\nSimpsonn one that I ordered. I still have all the packaging and have not\r\nattempted to mount anything. I'd like to return the baseplate and apply the\r\nrefund as credit toward the U shaped haptic brackets for brake and\r\nthrottle as well as the new HS pro shifter. Is that possible? Should I\r\nstart a return through amazon for just the baseplate?\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\nJustin Jones\r\n\r\n",
