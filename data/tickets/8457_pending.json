      "body_text": "Hi Valerie Vance,  Could you please let me know which ticket you previously submitted? I’ll check the issue for you. Also, please confirm whether your pedals are the Pro Plus model and if the firmware version is 1.7.1. If so, you can upgrade to the latest SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 software to calibrate the pedals.         For Pro series control boxes: If the version is 1.7.1, you can update the firmware via: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-plus.sfu (This method does not apply to 1.7.0 control boxes.)    For PlusX pedals: Only the plusx.sfu firmware can be used for updates.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
