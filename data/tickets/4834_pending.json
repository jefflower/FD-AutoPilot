      "body_text": "Hi Samuel Morin,    Please first check the version number shown at the bottom left of the software. If it is 1.7.1, we recommend updating to the latest version SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2. Please follow the steps below to perform the update.   After connecting the device, if you see a message saying “Version too old, not supported” or Simsonn Flasher mode, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, make sure to recalibrate the pedals, as they will not function properly in games without calibration.           https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
