      "body_text": "Hi Dannyhughes78, We noticed your feedback that the red damper feels too stiff. Please note that it is a silicone damper, available in standard hardness levels of 60HA, 70HA, and 80HA. The stiffness you feel may be due to a short travel setting. Please refer to the following guide for adjustment.      Our brake spring incorporates a 10 mm travel-limiting spacer, designed primarily to simulate the brake travel of Formula 1 cars.    With the spacer installed, it delivers the short-travel feel typical of F1 braking.    With the spacer removed, the brake pedal travel is increased, making it better suited for rally racing.    Specifications:    Spring length: 16.5 mm    Spacer thickness: 10 mm    Effective travel with spacer: (16.5−10)÷2=3.25 mm(16.5 - 10) ÷ 2 = 3.25\\text{ mm}(16.5−10)÷2=3.25 mm   Effective travel without spacer: 16.5÷2=8.25 mm16.5 ÷ 2 = 8.25\\text{ mm}16.5÷2=8.25 mm   Removing the spacer significantly increases the spring’s working travel, providing a softer pedal feel that is more suitable for prolonged braking and the varied conditions of rally racing.",
