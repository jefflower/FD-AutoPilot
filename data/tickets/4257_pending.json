  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn,\r\n\r\nIt feels like you’re saving up for Christmas, right? But what if you didn’t\r\nneed to save to enjoy the season? Did you know your store Simsonn could\r\nactually fund your Christmas?\r\n\r\nI understand the self-doubt about making sales but between now and the\r\nfestive season, you can earn more than you expect with just a few smart\r\nfixes. It could completely turn your store around.\r\n\r\nWould you like me to walk you through how to hit your year-end goals in the\r\nmonths ahead?\r\n\r\n",
