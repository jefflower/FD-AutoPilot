  "description_text": "Hi,\n\nCouple issues. Having used the sim in couple months.\n\nfound the some of the SQ buttons not working and it's not showing up in the Simsonn manager.\n\nIn game devices button 2 is showing as always on and only button 1 is showing as working.\nI have disconnected it from the PC and tried different usb. The usb is sounding disconnected/connected when unplugging or plugging back in.\n\nI updated to Simsonn Manager 2.1.0 and still not showing. See attached.\n\nAlso I have set Simsonn manager to English but it still shows most parts in Chinese.\n\nI will send video in a second email.\n\nThanks,\n\nNick",

      "body_text": "Hello, Nick Bell,     Please uninstall your current version and then install our version 2.1.1.  At the bottom of the sequential shifter (indicated by the arrow), there is a recovery button. Use a toothpick to gently push it to the other side, and then reconnect the USB cable. The device will enter recovery mode.  Next, in the software, go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → seq-firmware → gear-sqpro.sfu  Once the firmware update is completed, run a test to verify its functionality.  Please note that after the upgrade, you must return the recovery button to its original position. You can also use the VKB tool to check the device connection status and confirm that the update was successful.        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link     https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0551/4739/7238/files/VKB_JoyTester_40fdd530-6057-437e-9b50-3ac2d59dbbcd.zip?v=1693176246",
