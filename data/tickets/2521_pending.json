  "description_text": "i was checking the tracking of this order on friday and was very happy to find out that was going to be delivered today ( i mean yesterday ) but didn't arrive then i check this morning and delivery was changed to monday 8/11/25    so i was disappointed but ok with that  and just now i check and says   that the package was returned to  sender today at 4:48 pm because incomplete address    bull shit i don't belive this    so what now ?\r\nis there another way to ship this that is not usps    and do i have to wait until u receive this return and then resend to me ?   can i reorder and when u get this return u can refund that ? i don't want to wait a week or so to get this  but i think i'm fuck anyway is saturday night so i don't think there is going to be anything to do until monday   i guess\r\nyou know i was thinking it was coming from china so i was expecting to be more than a week to be delivered but when i check tracking and says that was going to be delivered last friday i just got frustrated because didn't happen\r\n\r\nso what I'm going to do is order again later or tomorrow so Monday can be send and when u get the returned one u can refund to my card\r\n\r\ni was thinking on cancelling this order but the haptic reactors i order they are coming from china and they get here in few days and i hate doing returns so i'm going to give it another try\r\n\r\nso just let me know when u get the return and hopefully u have another delivery option and i will order again this pedals\r\n\r\nty\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: SIMSONN <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSent: Wednesday, August 6, 2025 2:40 AM\r\nTo: alvarodo@msn.com <alvarodo@msn.com>\r\nSubject: A shipment from order #SSN2257 is on the way\r\n\r\nSIMSONN<https://www.simsonn.com/_t/c/v3/AAC-QjYB2fxo4Gq57HpuXuZVRHeFXCm6EX5aBE8QG7y_DGU6Iz3XyEgQq7qiyvygV6XbBO3mNp8ZaMAIxTJN8vYc9aNyoSwKOV4UjiF9p40QrV4oRngW6dXMtd1M3wUzyW1ZPtAmNuk6zoHUU2blxsXmcvsbfLW4HFDmMAIHtq7MzY1bjFnyzIGSPik0iwouDznot7KOXalIWxdJ010MPFwIHRz0CsFZG_e_LZ3IDd2LbuQqbwbJgEWSJvif8ql6kJ0oYD3cDQ6vOUGEzBl96JDuInFMaj2VGyCyfAlAiQ37aoPGuDl9y4ngNuKUhPQxFIZnNr-_Edt0wSZIodNw>\r\nOrder #SSN2257\r\nOne item in your order is on the way\r\n\r\nOne item in your order is on the way.
