Regarding USB disconnections, please plug the pedals directly into the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your computer and avoid using a USB hub, as this issue is usually caused by insufficient power.    Also, please ensure that both your computer and the base are properly grounded, meaning the plug or power strip should be connected to a three-prong wall outlet.",
