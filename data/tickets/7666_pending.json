Since I had the pedals delivered to my friend’s address in Austria, hoping they would arrive sooner, I would like to know if there is a chance that the pedals will arrive at his place by December 19th? He is coming to Bosnia and Herzegovina then, and it would be ideal if he could bring them to me because I am currently in the process of assembling my first sim racing rig, so I’m hoping I can start using it as soon as possible.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you in advance for your reply.\r\n> Kind regards, \r\n> \r\n> Damir Tahirović.\r\n\r\n",
