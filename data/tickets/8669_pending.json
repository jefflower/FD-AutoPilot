  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn team,\r\nMy name is Adrien Lugnot, I’m a sim racer competing in the MX5 United iRacing league. A few weeks ago I contacted you to ask for permission to run your logo on my car. I’ve now finished the 2025 season as AM class champion.\r\nI was very proud to achieve this title using your pedals and carrying the Simsonn logo on my car throughout the season. It felt great to represent your brand on track.\r\nI will continue this adventure in Season 3 of MX5 United and I’m looking forward to racing again with your pedals and your logo on my car.\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdrien Lugnot\r\n? 0695204443\r\n✉️ adrien082002@hotmail.fr\r\n\r\n\r\n",
