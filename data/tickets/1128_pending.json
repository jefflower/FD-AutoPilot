  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn support team,\n\nI'm using successfully Plus X pedals with Haptics Pro motors. Super happy with my purchase, everything works fine !!\n\nI contact you as I noticed a strange issue with Gearshift effect in Automobilista 2. Haptic effect happens with huge lag (at least 1 second after gearshift), and does not apply the configured effect. Setup frequency, strength and duration seems ignored.I tried on both pedals, same issue.\nThere is no issue on ACC. All effects works as intended, included Gearsift.\n\nRegards\nMathieu.\r\n",

In the meantime, you can download SimHub version 9.9.3, which fully supports SIMSONN devices and provides telemetry support for over 100 racing games. We recommend using it as your primary solution. ",
