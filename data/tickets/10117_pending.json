  "description_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nI have purchased directly from your website the pedals Pro X Ultra with the\r\nVAM Pro haptics in July 2025.\r\n\r\nRight from the start, always had a few problems with haptics disconnecting\r\nevery once in a while. Tried pretty much everything I've researched in the\r\nWeb, like buying a ferrite USB cable, using a USB ground loop isolator and\r\ngrounding the pedals and control box.\r\nThis did not solve the issues but made it manageable, and 95% of the time\r\npedals and haptics worked and when they disconnected, unplugging and\r\nplugging the USB made everything ok.\r\n\r\nA few days ago everything stopped working, pedals disconnect after 2 or 3\r\nminutes, haptics start vibrating non-stop and the usual method of\r\nunplug and re-plug doesn't work anymore. I have changed nothing and, as far\r\nas I know, this happened suddenly.\r\n\r\nI've tried everything, disconnected everything, connected back, checked all\r\nwiring and connections, re-installed the program manager, reinstalled\r\nfirmware etc etc and the problem persists.\r\n\r\nIf I disconnect the haptics, the pedals alone are working, but I want to\r\nuse (and paid for) the haptics together with the pedals.\r\n\r\nCan you please let me know how can I resolve this situation? The product is\r\nstill under guarantee and should work without any issues.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nEduardo\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Eduardo Mendes,      If this occurs, it indicates that your PC’s grounding may be unreliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used in a grounded wall outlet. You can refer to the post below and connect the three metal screws on the PC case, control box, and pedals, which should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
