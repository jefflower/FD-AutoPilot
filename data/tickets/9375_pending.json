  "description_text": "I purchased the 3-pedal Pro X set a few months back and am just getting them set up but I am having some issues. Firstly, it has been very difficult getting the usb to connect, I have to unplug everything and reconnect multiple times before I’m able to get a stable connection in your software. Once the pedals do connect, if I attempt to actuate any of them I immediately lose the usb connection. Additionally I have been unable to update the firmware on the controller box, when I try to apply an update the software says update complete but still shows me on old CPU1:v2.0.0 CPU2:v2.0.0 firmware. Please advise.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n-Brendan Monagle\r\nbrendanmonagle@gmail.com\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi brendan monagle,     Please uninstall any older versions of SIMSONN Manager from your PC, then download and install the latest version SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2. After installation, update the firmware to CPU1: 2.0.5 and CPU2: 2.0.4, and then test the device again.  Additionally, please make sure the USB cable is connected directly to a rear USB 3.0 (blue) port on your PC. Do not use USB 2.0 ports or USB hubs without independent power supply.",
