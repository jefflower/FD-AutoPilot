  "description_text": "Hi, question about this wheel: Simsonn Leather Steering Wheel – Precision and Luxury Combined – SIMSONN<https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-racing-simulator-leather-steering-wheel>\r\n\r\nI have seen many wheels on for example AliExpress where the dimensions say \"13 inch, 320 mm\". Now that's an error because 13 inches is actually 330 mm.\r\n320 mm is actually 12.6 inches.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind I was wondering what the diameter on your wheel is in mm? Is it in fact 330 mm, or is it actually 320 mm?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTrygve\r\n\r\n",
