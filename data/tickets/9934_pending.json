  "description_text": "I am experiencing a serious issue with my SIMSONN Plus X pedals, which I\r\nhave not been able to resolve despite extensive troubleshooting.The pedals\r\nare shown as Connected in the SIMSONN software and profiles can be created\r\nand saved. However, the pedals do not output any axis signals to Windows.   In\r\nthe Windows game controller test (joy.cpl → SIMSONN Plus X → Test), no axis\r\nmovement is shown when pressing throttle or brake — even with high force on\r\nthe brake pedal.Because of this, the pedals also do not work in any game.\r\n\r\nPedals are correctly detected in Windows Device Manager as HID devices. SIMSONN\r\nsoftware reinstalled multiple times. New profiles created (no old profiles\r\nloaded). Multiple PC restarts. USB connected directly to motherboard (no\r\nUSB hub). Removed all conflicting software (vJoy, Joystick Gremlin,\r\nSimHub). Steam Input disabled. Game reinstalled\r\n\r\nDespite this, no axis input reaches Windows at all.It appears that the\r\npedals show as connected at firmware/software level, but do not send any\r\ninput data to the operating system.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nTimo\r\n\r\n",

Please do not use the older SimConfigPedals V4 software, as it is not compatible with PlusX pedals.  Also, please ignore the Windows game controller test (joy.cpl). This interface is not applicable for validating PlusX pedal signals. All calibration and testing must be performed inside SIMSONN Manager.  If, after calibration, you can see the blue signal bars moving smoothly from 0% to 100% in SIMSONN Manager when pressing the pedals, this confirms that the hardware is functioning correctly. You only need to bind and calibrate the pedals inside the game.  Please let me know which game you are using. If it is a Steam-based racing title (such as Assetto Corsa or Assetto Corsa Competizione), I can guide you step by step through the in-game setup.",

Click “Start Update” and wait until the firmware is completely written. During this process do not disconnect the USB or close the application.    Once the update is finished (you’ll get a success prompt or the unit will reboot), unplug and re‑plug the USB then test the pedal device to confirm everything works correctly.",
