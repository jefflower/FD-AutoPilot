I could ship them out on a daily basis, not like your recent reseller in about 1 week. If you are interested please let me know. I am getting into this business and want to start with a product that i am also interested in. I am reachable via this email. \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nBastian Torkildsen\r\n\r\n",

At the moment, we already have our warehouse and fulfillment system in place, so we don’t have a need for additional storage locations.  That said, we’ll definitely keep your information on record in case we expand our distribution network in the future.  Thank you again for reaching out and for your support of Simsonn!     Best regards, The Simsonn Team",
