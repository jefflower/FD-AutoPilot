After reloading my PC, I see \"disconnected\" status in simsonn software, and \"driver error\" on a window devices screen. I have latest update of your software, and can't find how to load drivers manually. Can you help me?",

If the issue persists, please follow these steps:    Press and hold the upgrade button on the control box;    Connect the USB cable — at this point, SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 will show that the device has entered SIMSONN Flasher Mode;    Go to Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu;    After the update is complete, please test the device again.",
