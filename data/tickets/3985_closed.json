They were working up to the\r\npoint I installed an external sound amp connected to the motherboard\r\nsound.  I have validated the proper 24v DC coming from the power supply.  I\r\nhave also swapped USB cables and ports.  The pedals are working fine. Only\r\nthe VAM Haptics are not.  Can you please provide some troubleshooting\r\nassistance?  Thank You.\r\n\r\nI am using the 2.10 Simsonn configuration application.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nJ. Sheldon\r\n\r\n",
