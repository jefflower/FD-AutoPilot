  "description_text": "I'd like to start off with saying that I am incredibly sorry for this\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n I ordered a Simsonn 6+R H pattern shifter on November 13 2025 and recently\r\nperformed a charge back that I now regret doing. I had the charge back done\r\nas the last movement on the package said it has arrived in Ottawa Ontario\r\nCanada but was at the YYZ airport (Toronto Person International). I\r\nattempted to call the number provided on your companies website to find out\r\nthat it is a phone number in China not England. Out of frustration I called\r\nmy credit card company and had a charge back done on November 29 as I felt\r\nthat with having two different airports listed as the arrival and no\r\nmovement on the tracking app I assumed it was not going to be delivered or\r\ndelivered anywhere near on time. I continued to check the app even after\r\nthe charge back to see there was still no updates on tracking. On November\r\n30 the package was delivered to my door. I then checked the SF\r\nINTERNATIONALS tracking and all of a sudden things had changed. I feel very\r\nbad over this and would like to make it right and fix this. I ordered this\r\nfor my husband as he loves your products we have bought in the past. How do\r\nI make this right and repay for this order? We want to keep the item. Again\r\nI am very sorry for this and want to make things right and pay for this.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\n\r\n Danielle Temple\r\n\r\n",
