  "description_text": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI am reaching out to report another issue with my throttle. I was sent a replacement for a broken part on my first throttle pedal. I installed the new one and it was running good for a while. But for the last few weeks now, the throttle has been sticking. It’s not the actual pedal but the sensor that sticks every so often. It’ll happen in the middle of a race and when I release the throttle pedal, the sensor maintains 100% throttle for 2-3 seconds before cutting off. It’s very frustrating as it has ruined several races now. Are there any know fixes to this issue? I’ve inspected the pedal and didn’t find any physical malfunctions. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

The throttle signal flickers/jumps erratically in DIView, Windows, and iRacing — even when the throttle pedal cable is completely unplugged.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhat I’ve tested:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDifferent USB ports\n \n \nSwapped cables between the brake and throttle\n \n \nConfirmed brake works fine\n \n \nTried calibration and firmware software\n \n \nThrottle input flickers in DIView even with no cable connected\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere’s no visible serial number on the unit, and it doesn’t show in the Simsonn software. \n \n Order number: SSN1791 \n Date of purchase: 06-18-2025 (june 18th) \n Purchased through simsonn website. \n   \n Attached is a video of what the USB controller is showing, both with and without pedals plugged in. \n   \n \nThanks,\n \n \nMichael Aliffi",
