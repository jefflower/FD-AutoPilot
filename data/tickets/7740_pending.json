Although i just cant find any confirmation that they fit my racing rig. I have the Trak Racer TR8 pro V2. Would you happen to know? I reached out to Trak Racer and they do not know. Also if you do know would i need the baseplate you guys offer to run these? \r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone \r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone \r\n",
