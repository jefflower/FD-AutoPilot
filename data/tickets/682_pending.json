      "body_text": "Hi vito rebaudo,     The ProX upgrade kit has been improved with a new damping material that offers better elasticity. The 8-stage damping system has been upgraded to a lighter version, allowing smooth compression and rebound across all 8 levels. Additionally, the kit now features a true hydraulic damper instead of a gas spring, delivering a more realistic racing pedal feel.   https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-pro-x-ultra-pedals-upgrade-kit",
