I can press harder, but force barely increases and the load goes into\r\nthe cockpit instead of the load cell.\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what the problem might be?\r\nCould you recommend the correct spring/elastomer setup to safely reach\r\nhigher brake force (around 100–120 kg) without bottoming out?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nVladimir\r\n\r\n",
