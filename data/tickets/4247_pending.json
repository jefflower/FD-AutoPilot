  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am opening a new request because I did not receive any reply to my\r\nprevious message. I want to make it clear that I am requesting a refund for\r\nmy pedals. Since the beginning, I have had constant problems: the pedals\r\ndisconnect randomly, sometimes they stop responding completely in the\r\nmiddle of a race, and they are overall unreliable.\r\n\r\nI already tried all suggested troubleshooting steps, but the problems\r\nremain. Because of this, I cannot use the pedals anymore. I therefore\r\nrequest a full refund. Please also confirm that the baseplate delivery,\r\nwhich has not arrived yet, will be cancelled so that I will not be charged\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTamino Hilkenbach\r\nOrder #SSN2717\r\n\r\n",

Here’s what you can do:    Plug the pedals directly into a USB 3.0 port (blue port) on the back of your PC instead of using a USB hub.    Try turning off all lighting effects. If the disconnection issue disappears, it confirms that the problem is caused by insufficient USB power supply.    Please note:    The ProX Ultra LED strips require around 400-800mA in total, while a typical USB 2.0 port only supplies up to 500mA, which is insufficient.       only supplies up to 500mA, which is insufficient.

However, if you choose to return them, the high international shipping costs would far exceed the value of the pedals themselves, which means they could only be scrapped locally. Our pedals are produced with very low profit margins, and our goal has always been to provide the best possible value for money.     From our experience, this issue is not necessarily caused by the pedals themselves. If there truly were frequent disconnection problems, our after-sales team would have already identified and fixed them. In fact, we have encountered many similar cases, and almost all of them were due to insufficient USB power supply from the customer’s PC. With some adjustments—such as switching to a rear USB 3.0 port or using a powered USB hub—the issue is usually resolved.     We sincerely hope to work with you to troubleshoot and solve this issue, rather than going through the return process, which would cause us significant losses and unnecessary inconvenience for you as well.",
