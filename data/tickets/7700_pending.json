This is strange since I’ve added them when making my order.\r\n\r\nCould I ask why is that? And if by some chance I haven’t added them to my\r\norder, is there a way that I can pay for those, and you’ll include them in\r\nmy main order? I don’t want to make a separate inquiry just for these two\r\nsmall parts.\r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nBuyer\r\n\r\n",
