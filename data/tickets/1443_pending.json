Unfortunately, Amazon won't\r\nlet me refund the item yet because the shipment details haven't been\r\ncompleted on their app.\r\n\r\nPlease reach out with a solution.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCollin Ezeonu.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Collins Ezeonu,      We can send you a replacement VAM. The damage to the throttle motor was likely caused by excessive travel and continuous rotation under Speed mode. We recommend setting a reasonable speed range and reducing the vibration intensity—ideally around 50%, and no more than 70%. Also, try to avoid prolonged continuous operation to extend the motor’s lifespan. ",
