      "body_text": "Hi Oscar Gastelum,     These are our two newest pedals, the Pro X Ultra has an adjustable hydraulic lever for the more seasoned pro rider. It has lights that give feedback based on game telemetry data, and a much nicer light and shape. If you don't need these features, the Plus X pedals will be better value for money as they have the same elastomers and hydraulics. https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-racing-sim-pedal-pro-x-ultra  https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-pro-plus-x-pedals",
