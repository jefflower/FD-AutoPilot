  "description_text": "Good morning\nI am writing about a problem I had with a VAM haptic motor. I purchased the complete set of motors with the relative power supply to connect to the Plus X pedal board, which was already equipped with a control box.\nAt first, everything worked correctly, but after only 20 minutes, one motor stopped working. I tried swapping the various motors, but only that one doesn't work. No error is displayed on the screen.\nI am attaching a video.\n\nThank you very much\nZamparutti Amedeo",
