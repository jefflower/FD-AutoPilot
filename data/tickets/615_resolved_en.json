  "description_text": "I purchased the Simsonn Pro X Ultra Sim Racing Pedals, and when I try to configure them in the game Assetto Corsa, the accelerator and clutch are recognized normally, but an issue occurred where only the brake cannot be recognized.\n\nThe pedals only have three outputs:\n1. Accelerator\n2. Brake\n3. Clutch\n\nHowever, in Assetto Corsa, a mysterious fourth signal is being recognized as the brake, and the actual second output signal for the brake cannot be recognized.\n*Note: In Assetto Corsa, when I press the brake, it is recognized as the second output signal. However, when I start the brake configuration, it gets recognized by the mysterious fourth output signal.\n\nIn the Simsonn Manager, all three pedals are recognized correctly.\n\nIs it not possible to stop this mysterious fourth output signal?",
