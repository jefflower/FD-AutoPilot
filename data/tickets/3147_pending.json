  "description_text": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI have recently just purchased and received your new VAM Pro haptic motors\r\nfor my SIMSONN pedals (As well as the necessary upgrade to the new control\r\nbox)\r\n\r\nHaving finally assembled everything, plugged in, updated firmware, and run\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that the pedals are now suffering from very severe EMI\r\ninterference, as the break pedals now passively increase their input\r\nwithout touching them (despite looking correct in the configuration page).\r\nI have used the pedals for a long time with the older connection box,\r\nwithout any issues, but now that I have the new box and the installed\r\nhaptic motors, this problem is occurring.\r\n\r\nIt seems I can't find anywhere to ground the box such that it doesn't\r\nrecieve this severe EMI.\r\n\r\nAny help with this matter would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nBest regards,\r\nShayan Jalalipour\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi shayan jalalipour,  Please try using nylon screws and washers to isolate the VAM Pro motor on the brake pedal from the metal bracket. Make sure to place the washers between the motor and the bracket, as this can immediately resolve the issue. The test is simple: detach the motor bracket from the pedal, and if the EMI disappears, the cause is confirmed. ",
