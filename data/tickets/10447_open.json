  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am contacting you regarding an issue with my *SIMSONN Pro X pedal set*.\r\n\r\nThe pedals are correctly detected by *Simsonn Manager*, and they work\r\nproperly within the software (all axes respond normally).\r\nHowever, *none of my simulation games detect the pedals* (Assetto Corsa,\r\niRacing, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have tried many solutions without success:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Multiple versions of *FreeJoy*\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Different USB ports (no USB hub)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Reinstalling drivers and software\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Reading and writing the configuration in FreeJoy\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Testing with several games and controller profiles\r\n\r\nI have also researched this issue using ChatGPT and various specialised\r\nwebsites and forums, but *no solution has resolved the problem*.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe the issue may be related to the pedal firmware or\r\ninternal configuration, since:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Simsonn Manager correctly recognises the pedals\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Windows detects the device properly\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Simulation games do not detect any pedal axes\r\n\r\nCould you please assist me by providing:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   An *official firmware* or a reset procedure\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   A *compatible FreeJoy configuration*\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Or any recommended solution to make the pedals detectable in games\r\n\r\nI would be happy to provide screenshots, videos, or any additional\r\ninformation if needed.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your support.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBar Ayrton\r\n\r\n<http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\r\nSans\r\nvirus.www.avg.com\r\n<http://www.avg.com/email-signature?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\r\n<#DAB4FAD8-2DD7-40BB-A1B8-4E2AA1F9FDF2>\r\n\r\n",

While holding the button, unplug the USB cable from the PC and then plug it back in. The software should detect the device entering “SIMSONN Flasher update mode”.    In the software go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update.    In the file selector choose: pedals‑firmware → pedals‑plusx.sfu.    Click “Start Update” and wait until the firmware is completely written. During this process do not disconnect the USB or close the application.    Once the update is finished (you’ll get a success prompt or the unit will reboot), unplug and re‑plug the USB then test the pedal device to confirm everything works correctly.",

I have carefully followed all the steps you provided and tried the procedure multiple times, but unfortunately it still does not work.  The device is not updating as expected, and the issue remains unchanged after several attempts. I must admit that I am disappointed not to have found a solution so far.

Please follow the steps below:    Click the “Calibrate” button;    When prompted, press each of the three pedals (throttle / brake / clutch) one by one with normal force;    After calibration, click Save.    During the post-calibration test, the blue progress bar should move smoothly from 0% to 100%. Only after a successful calibration with the full signal range will the pedals be correctly recognized by the game. If the signal range is too small, the game will not be able to detect or bind the pedal input properly.",
