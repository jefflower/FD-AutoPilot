The post code (35010) and address I\r\nprovided is correct.\r\n\r\nI paid for standard shipping and the order was made 11 days ago. The pedals\r\nhave been in sweden for more than a week. Its a little strange. See\r\nattached image.\r\n\r\nDo you mind investigating this\r\n\r\nmany thanks,\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n[image: tracking.postnord.com_se_tracking_id=CE326618054DE.png]\r\n\r\n",
