Slide the button horizontally to the other side, then reconnect the USB cable. The device will enter upgrade mode.    Once in upgrade mode, follow the steps below to complete the restoration process.        handbrake：    At the front bottom of the handbrake (indicated by the arrow), there is a small rectangular hole that contains the recovery button. Please use a toothpick to gently push it to the other side, then reconnect the USB cable. The device will enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → handbrake-firmware → handbrake-hbpro.sfu in the software, and complete the update. After the upgrade, make sure to switch the recovery button back to its original position        seq shifter:  At the lower side of the sequential shifter (as indicated by the arrow), there is a recovery button.
