I am looking for new pedal sets for test and to sell with sim rigs.\r\n\r\nCouple of questions.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make an order without VAT? I have valid VAT-number for my company.\r\n\r\nDo you ship from outside of Great Britain? There is a tax issue with shipping from GB to Finland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am currently planning to buy 2 sets of pedals, shifters (seq) and handbrakes for my newest builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nTimo Pohja\r\n\r\nTA-Solutions Oy\r\n\r\nFinland\r\n",
