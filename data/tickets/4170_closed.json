But as soon as I fire up iracing they just vibrate one speed, one\r\ntone, no increase with rpm, no brake shake with lockup. The throttle was\r\njust one note, solid. It wouldn't quit even when I exited the program. I\r\nhad to unplug it to make it stop. Now it says power disconnected but its\r\nnot. Any ideas??\r\n\r\n",
