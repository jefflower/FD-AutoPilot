  "description_text": "Good day,\r\n\r\nI got my pedals back in January and they worked just fine until today, I connected them and the sofware still says they are disconected, try unplugging everything and plug it again, tried to reinstall the software several times, installed the 2.0.8 and the 2.0.9 and nothing, they used to light on blue and now just the gas pedal lights blue the other light white, I just missed a race of an important championship here in Costa Rica due to this, is there anything I could do, or are they dead?\r\n\r\nHopefully you can guide me on this.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nChristopher Gómez Sibaja\r\nAntiGravity Sim Racing CEO & Driver\r\n[cid:bb271a15-e457-4f73-b6e8-f73f8cf09263]\r\n\r\n",

Then, in the same interface, click Manual Firmware Update, navigate to the pedals-firmware folder → pedals folder, and select the prox.sfu file to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, please run the test again.     You can use the Offset function to reset the pedal percentage to zero. This ensures that each pedal's progress bar starts at around 0%. After applying the Offset, please recalibrate the pedals again. ",
