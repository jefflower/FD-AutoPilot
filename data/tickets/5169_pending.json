  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am a content creator and have seen a lot of your posts recently and like\r\nwhat I see of your pedals.\r\n\r\nI do have a couple of questions though if you can help.\r\n\r\n1. Can hese pedals connect directly to a fanatec base. E.g the DD Pro\r\n\r\n2. Can these work on PS5 without the need for a PC\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally could you provide some information in your affiliate programme\r\nand also what the process is for getting a set of pedals for review.\r\n\r\nMy YouTube channel is https://youtube.com/@chunkyribena?si=3inDvJSb8EhS3GEh\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nHelder Ribeiro\r\n\r\n",

If they are PC only at this moment a review might\r\nnot be best as I focus on both console and pc equipment so being pc only\r\nwouldn't fit too well for my viewers needs.\r\n\r\nI'll inform if that changes or please advise if you ever add capabilities\r\nfor console.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nHelder\r\n\r\n",
