  "description_text": "So I recently order your \r\nSIMSONN Upgraded PRO Plus Sim Racing Pedals 200KG Load Cell Brake Pedal HE Hydraulic Pedal Black (P3-3 Hydraulic Rods) off Amazon not knowing about your website long with not knowing you make haptics.  But ended up finding out about your haptic for the pedals and ordered them off your website.  At the time I ordered the haptics I didn’t receive the pedal set yet and thought that the pedal control box for the haptics would come w the pedals I recently order.  I didnt get a control box with the haptic control.  So since my order hasn’t shipped yet is there a way to add that to my order?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHyun lee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please avoid using a USB hub—make sure to plug the device directly into a USB 3.0 port on your computer. Unstable power supply is usually the main cause of disconnection problems.  Additionally, if you notice input lag or data delays, please disable \"Level of Filtering\", then click Save to apply the changes. You can also use the VKB tool to test the response curve.     The spark is not an issue—many Apple chargers behave similarly. It occurs when the capacitor in the motor is being charged. It won’t damage the mainboard and poses no safety risk, as the voltage is only 24V. ",
