Since iron products are prone to scratches and other signs of use, we are typically unable to resell them. If your product is in perfect condition, you may return the package to our US warehouse. We will process your refund after receiving and inspecting the item. However, please ensure the packaging is intact and the product shows no signs of use—otherwise, your return request will not be approved!  ​MaZon CA Chino 13402 YORBA AVENUE, Unit 102, Chino, CA  91710 USA +1 480-387-3114",
