  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI bought 3x VAM haptic motors (normal version, not VAM PRO) from your Aliexpress official store about two weeks ago. I mounted them on a SIMSONN PRO X ULTRA SIM pedal kit also.\r\n\r\nThe pedals work really great, but i have problems with the VAM motors because they are not working correctly.\r\n\r\nThe motors are installed correctly, they work great 70-80% of time and the tests with your software runs great. But at random points, the VAM motors start to vibrate nonstop or just stop working. Even if i close the game, the motors don't stop spinning until i manually disconnect them.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens with the brake motor, sometimes with the accelerator motor, sometimes does not happen for 10 minutes or sometimes does happen every 30 seconds. Sometimes they start to rumble only with the menu open, sometimes don't.\r\n\r\nI tried multiple games (Asseto Corsa, Asseto Corsa Competizione, Dirt Rally 2.0, IRacing...) and also your latest software and even the SimHub app to run the VAM motors but the problems still persist.\r\n\r\nI also tried all the combinations of effects, frecuencies and gains in every software and game, but nothing works.\r\n\r\n¿You know why this happens? I read in forums that maybe is a problem with EMI interference, but i don't have any USB disconnects, only random vibrations and non-stop rumble sometimes. The pedals work fine 100% of time, the problem is only with the VAM motors.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me. The pedals and VAM motors are brand new and i use a full cockpit with a MOZA R9 base and SIMSONN PRO ULTRA SIM pedals.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
