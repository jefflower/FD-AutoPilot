  "description_text": "Hello,\r\nI wanted to ask why, when I want to purchase for example plus x pedals,\r\nthere is nothing about an additional cost of tax, but when I change it to a\r\nVAM 2 pack set it shows that I have to cover an additional cost. My\r\nquestion is where does this come from and is there anything I can do about\r\nit (for example wait for you to provide EU warehouses with them if that is\r\nthe case)? My address is in Poland for context.\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n",
