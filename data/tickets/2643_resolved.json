      "body_text": "Hi EITAN LAEL,    Please try manually updating the pedal firmware:    Press the upgrade button on the main controller board, then reconnect the USB cable.    The SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 software will automatically enter recovery mode.    In the software, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware-prox.sfu to update.    After the update is complete, test the pedals again.    If the issue still persists, please download ToDesk (no registration required), provide us with the temporary ID and password, and we can schedule a time to remotely assist you in resolving the problem.",
