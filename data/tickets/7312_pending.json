There has been a problem with the\r\ndelivery, stating that the packet was oversize\\overweight and it has been\r\nresended to you (I guess). I have atached two screenshots from the delivery\r\nservice website, where states this problem and the new waybill number,\r\nconfirming that the packet has been received (by you i guess).\r\n\r\nOld waybill: SF6047082678264\r\n\r\nNew waybill: SF3295212713544\r\n\r\nAll of this without any update in the simsonn website.\r\n\r\nI hope you can solve this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nIgnacio.\r\n\r\n",
