  "description_text": "Hello\r\n\r\nI have recently purchased your Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedal set via Amazon and\r\na part is missing from the main pedal set and part of my order haptic\r\nmotors) has not been delivered at all?\r\n\r\nMissing Part\r\n\r\nHaving built the pedals I believe their is a part missing, I have the\r\ncarbon part of the  ‘heightening plate’ but this appears to be very weak\r\nand bending with my heels in place which makes me believe that this should\r\nbe supported by a metal heightening plate part to reinforce the ‘carbon\r\nheightening plate’ which is missing in the packaging. I have checked very\r\ncarefully and it is not in the box.\r\n\r\nI understand the carbon part is an add on which should sit on top of a\r\nmetal heightening plate underneath it to provide strength. This metal plate\r\nis missing completely. Without this the carbon plate is likely to break so\r\nis currently unusable so I need this resolving quickly please.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot delivered at all\r\n\r\nI have also ordered the\r\nSIMSONN Pro X Ultra Racing Simulator Hydraulic Pedals Sim Racing Pedals -\r\nwith Haptic Reactor (Optional) (VAM PRO 2)\r\nWhich has not been delivered at all so would like an update on when if and\r\nwhen this will arrive?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your quick response please\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nIan Matthews\r\n\r\n",
