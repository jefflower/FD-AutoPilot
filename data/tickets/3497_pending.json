  "description_text": "Hi I bought the pedals a few months ago and had issues only with the brake pedal.\r\nWhenever I don’t touch it, it inputs at 100 then as soon as I press it, it goes from 0-100 instantly almost like it’s not acting as a load cell pedal. Do you have any advice to fix this I have grounded it as shown in the photos as well as bought a usb isolator to try and solve the solution\r\n",

If the interface shows “Version too old, not supported,” please go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, please be sure to recalibrate the pedals, as they will not function properly in games without calibration.   https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
