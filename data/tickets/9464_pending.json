  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThe tracking for this order once it reached the US went to the USPS tracking #9200190406975502247484 which shows that it was seized by the USPS because it was counterfeit and will be kept by them and not delivered.\r\n\r\nI paid for express shipping which said 2 to 5 days. It has now been 13 days and it looks like I won't be getting it at all. My previous control box has stopped working and I need this quickly, as my pedals are completely useless without it. Is there any way you could ship me one with a more reliable and quicker service, such as Fedex or UPS?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJay\r\n\r\n",
