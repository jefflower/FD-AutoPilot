  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a set of prox pedals and I downloaded LeMans Ultimate and suddenly the throttle isn't working. It doesn't register at all in the Simpsonn manager but I can unplug it from the throttle port on the control box into the clutch or brake and it registers. I used it 12 hours ago and nothing has changed other than a game download. \r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
