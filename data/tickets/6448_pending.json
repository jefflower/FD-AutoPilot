      "body_text": "Hi Andrej Vojvoda,  If you find the red damping too stiff, you can remove the 10mm limiter spacer on the brake pedal’s black spring to increase the pedal travel. After this adjustment, please recalibrate the pedal; full compression of the damping is not required. For detailed instructions, please refer to the manual. ",
