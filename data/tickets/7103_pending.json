  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently bought the pro x ultra pedals and upon inspecting my brake pedal\r\nI see there are two wires that come out from underneath, you have one which\r\nconnects to the control box and another wire I am unsure what it connects\r\nto. It’s a black, red, and white wire. I attached an image for reference!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMarcio S.\r\n\r\n",
