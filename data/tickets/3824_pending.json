  "description_text": "I recently bought them on Amazon a few weeks ago and they recently stopped working. Tried on 2 games. Tested in simsonn software and simhub. I’m not sure if it’s software or it’s the haptic motors. The pedals and motors are recognized in software but doesn’t vibrate. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
