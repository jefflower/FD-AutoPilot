Please connect it directly to the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC, avoid using a USB hub, or try another computer for testing.  If the light is off, it may indicate a damaged data cable or a faulty control box.         All our products are tested and pedals are calibrated before leaving the factory, so it’s unlikely that the control box is faulty. If it is indeed defective, we will send you a replacement control box next Monday. Please don’t worry.",
