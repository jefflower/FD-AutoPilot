      "body_text": "Hi Carlos Silva,    First, please make sure your software is updated to the latest SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 and that the pedal firmware is also up to date. If everything is already updated, the issue may be caused by unstable USB power supply or EMI interference from the wheelbase.  Please connect the pedal’s USB cable directly to the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC and avoid using a USB hub to ensure stable power delivery. Additionally, if the wheelbase and PC are using a two-prong power plug, it may result in poor grounding, or the wall socket itself might lack proper grounding. You can refer to the following methods for troubleshooting.       To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LciAFDFWJ1w  ",
