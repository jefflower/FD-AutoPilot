  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n I'm writing to see if we can find a easier solution for both parties. My Order\r\nID: 111-5031868-2390644 of the 3 vam kit, power supply, and mounting kit\r\nhas resulted in two Vam units already malfunctioning. The third is\r\ncurrently being used. I have already set up a return with Amazon but\r\nhaven't shipped my item back yet. Now I can just go through with the return\r\nbut I was hoping for just a simple exchange of the malfunctioning parts or\r\npotential paying a slight upcharge for a Vam pro upgrade potentially.  I\r\njust would hate to have to unmount all this from my pedals and ship it off\r\njust to do it again potentially. Please let me know if there are any\r\noptions we can pursue besides doing a return and refund with Amazon.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nKyle Simpson\r\ngeneralpatton71@gmail.com\r\nGeneralpatton71@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n",

We recommend setting a reasonable speed range and reducing the vibration intensity—ideally around 50%, and no more than 70%. Also, try to avoid prolonged continuous operation to extend the motor’s lifespan.\r\n>\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n> service@simsonn.com\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> *发件人：* kyle S <generalpatton71@gmail.com>\r\n> *发送时间：* 2025-08-18 08:23\r\n> *收件人：* service ",
