That’s it.\r\n\r\nIf you’re even a little curious, I can send over more info or show how it might look for your setup.\r\n\r\nTotally fine if not the right time, just thought I’d offer in case it’s useful later on.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nWajih Khan\r\nAdam Parker Accountants \r\n\r\nOn Fri, August 22, 2025 8:33 AM, Adam Parkers <ap@adamparkersaccountants.website>\r\n[ap@adamparkersaccountants.website]> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hey again.\r\n> \r\n> Just following up with a couple of examples.\r\n> \r\n> We helped one online store save over £60K in tax in their first year through proactive tax planning.
