Today, when I turned on my PC, it suddenly told\r\nme I was in the flash menu. So I unplugged the USB, pressed the button,\r\nplugged the USB back in, and it still said it was in flasher mode. I\r\nunplugged it for two minutes and restarted my PC. I've tried everything,\r\nbut it just won't work with this box anymore! What can we do?\r\n\r\nOrder#SSN3903\r\n\r\nmfg\r\n\r\n",
