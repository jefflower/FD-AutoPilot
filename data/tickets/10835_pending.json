It costed\r\n292.79€, it was ordered the day 3/1/2026 and it was destined to Spain,\r\nBarcelona, Barberà del Vallès Carrer del Pintor Goya nº50 1º1ª.\r\n\r\nI believe i put this email on the payment, but still, as a\r\nconfirmation i'll send you the screenshot of the bank account\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nThank you for everything,\r\n\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n",
