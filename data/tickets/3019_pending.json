If it shows “Not Supported,” please go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update. After completing the update, please make sure to recalibrate the pedals, otherwise they will not function properly in games. In addition, if SIMSONN Manager shows “Not Connected,” please download and run the VKB JoyTester tool, then send me a screenshot so I can verify.

Having some direct support with sim gear would let me actually use\r\nand showcase your products in my training and content.
