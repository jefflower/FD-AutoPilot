SIMHUB supports up to 100 racing titles, covering nearly all major games. I can provide you with an internal version for now, as the official SIMHUB update will be released a bit later.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrSbAvCC5iyx9XgdRgSQV-hWpmDGkujc/view?usp=sharing",

The USB cord has to be unplugged and plugged in again, but sometimes that's not even enough and the power have to be disconnected. On that note: when inserting the power plug into the control box it sparks.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that the VAM often starts humming, even when not having been fed a signal. Often quite violently. The only solution is to pull the power. Just now they started humming without even being connected to the PC, only to the power!\r\n\r\nDo you have any solutions or a roadmap for getting this product working? Perhaps you should have held off the launch a couple of months? At least not have a big picture that says \"perfectly comparable with SIMHUB software\"...\r\n\r\nIf a fix is not available in the immediate future I think I'll have to return the product. Will you kindly supply me with a return address so I can look up how expensive it'll be?\r\n\r\nI get that it's a new product, but one is justified in expecting that the product works to some extent.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJesper Lund\r\nDenmark\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",

If you're using SIMHUB for connection, all telemetry-related commands—such as starting or stopping vibration—are sent directly by SIMHUB. I'll send you the latest SIMHUB version for testing. Also, please let us know which game you're currently using.  Important notes:    Make sure to connect the USB cable directly to a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC, not through a USB hub, as hubs can cause unstable power or data transmission.    If you're using the PlusX controller, please check whether there is a green ground wire. If so, connect it to a screw on the pedal or mounting bracket to ensure proper grounding.     https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5kEGqiBUoGbt3qYI03tZ0NQ1VuhzOgv/view",

      "body_text": "Hi Jesper L,     We noticed you mentioned a spark when plugging in the 24V power connector—this is actually normal. The spark occurs because the system needs to charge three internal capacitors, similar to when you plug a power cord into a wall outlet. Since the unit doesn’t have a dedicated power switch, this behavior is expected and is consistent with how Simagic devices work. Please rest assured—this is not an issue.  We’re confident this can be resolved quickly, and we're also working closely with SIMHUB to optimize compatibility and performance.  By the way, could you let us know the brand of your wheelbase? Also, is your PC properly grounded? Good grounding helps ensure overall system stability and reduces interference.",

But it's listed as fitting the Simagic haptic reactors, which apparently fits your products just as well.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the guy that made the design is the same as the guy who made the video and the reddit post.\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SimsonnRacing/comments/1nu0cn0/comparison_of_vam_pros_with_3d_printed_mount/\r\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6905682\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Bx8SV0KpQ&t=65s\r\n________________________\r\nNow I got a hold of you I have a question: Is it possible to have two Simsonn control boxes show up in the SimHub menu?\r\n\r\nI.e. can you control 6 VAM Pros through SimHub by hooking up 2 control boxes, or does SimHub only allow for one USB haptic controller?\r\n\r\nBW Jesper\r\n________________________________\r\n",

Since the clutch installation method cannot yet be standardized, we are still exploring a better approach to make it compatible with horizontal mounting brackets. In addition, SimHub currently does not support running two main controllers with six VAM Pro units simultaneously, which may lead to conflicts.",
