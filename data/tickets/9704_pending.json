  "description_text": "\r\nHello and happy new years! I’m just sending a email regarding my clutch pedal. It just stopped working randomly, everything seems to be intact, no wires disconnected, I can press it in. It’s just not getting an input in the software I guess. I haven’t had the pedals for to long and I honestly love them. Wondering if you guys know a fix or the problem! Thanks again!\r\n\r\nHere’s my order number if it helps - SSN1958\r\n",
