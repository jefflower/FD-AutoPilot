  "description_text": "Hi, I was setting my Sim rig back up and tried to recalibrate my Simsonn\r\nPlus X\r\npedals but I saw that there is new software and I have no idea where to\r\nupdate my pedals. I tried to manually update but it's still not reading.\r\nIts saying that it's an old version. I get taken to an error page when I\r\ntry to download driver software.\r\n\r\nI checked Amazon and it seems like there was a big upgrade to the pedals\r\nand the controller from when I bought it back in February of this year.\r\n\r\nI am probably asking for too much but is it possible to be sent replacement\r\npedals? Or a legit file where I can download and update the pedals?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\n\r\n",
