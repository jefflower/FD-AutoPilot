      "body_text": "Hi Patrick Antolak,  It depends on which country you are in. Our US warehouse currently has stock available and can ship within 24 hours. Both UPS and FedEx offer fast delivery. The German warehouse is experiencing some delays due to customs clearance, with a small backlog of orders, but new stock is expected to be available in the next few days. Please don’t worry. ",
