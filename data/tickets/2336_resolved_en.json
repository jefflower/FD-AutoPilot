Still waiting on the pedalplate but it’s waiting for delivery.\n\nI was trying to get the VAM haptics to work in iracing, but no success so far. They show as connected in the simsonn application and can test the rumble, but ingame I don’t feel them..\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you in advance\nDave",

What should I do with the haptics in simsonn manager, because they show up there, but I configured them for iracing in simhub. Should I disconnect them in Simsonn manager somehow?
