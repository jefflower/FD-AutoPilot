Recently, I’ve noticed that the pedals are responding too sensitively to input, which is affecting performance and overall usability.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise on whether this is a known issue and if there are any recommended adjustments, firmware updates, or potential repairs I should consider? I’d also appreciate any troubleshooting steps you suggest to help resolve the matter.\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
