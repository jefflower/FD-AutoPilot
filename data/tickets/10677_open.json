Please choose another courier who can send me the product faster. I have been waiting for the package for a month. My son keeps asking me about the Christmas gift. Please help me with the delivery of the package. \r\n    On Monday, 12 January 2026 at 16:08:36 EET, SIMSONN <no-reply@loox.io> wrote:  \r\n \r\n #yiv7977740516 td.yiv7977740516rate-item {padding-top:8px;}#yiv7977740516 span.yiv7977740516rate-item {text-align:center;font-size:12px;}#yiv7977740516 td.yiv7977740516star {width:32px;}#yiv7977740516 a.yiv7977740516star {max-width:24px;}#yiv7977740516 img.yiv7977740516star {max-width:24px !important;}@media screen and (min-width:425px) {#yiv7977740516 td.yiv7977740516rate-item {padding-top:12px;}#yiv7977740516 span.yiv7977740516rate-item {font-size:14px;}#yiv7977740516 td.yiv7977740516star {width:45px;}#yiv7977740516 a.yiv7977740516star {max-width:unset;}#yiv7977740516 img.yiv7977740516star {max-width:32px !important;}}\r\n| Hello Petre, We would be grateful if you shared how things look and feel.
