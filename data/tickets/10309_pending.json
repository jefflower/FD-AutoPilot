  "description_text": "Hey,\r\n\r\nWhen i set deadzones in the software how i want, like 5% bottom deadzone on the brake,  it doesnt behave the same in games.\r\nIn game its about half of that and input comes sooner in game than it shows in the software.\r\n\r\nDIview software(with this its easy to see actual % difference vs your software %), Le mans Ultimate, ACC, all behaves the same.\r\n\r\nI have to work around this by applying 10% deadzone instead of 5% to software or apply additional deadzone in game to get about the same results/feeling.\r\n\r\nSame with the Gas pedal.\r\nI want 2% bottom and 3% top deadzones in software, but to get same results in game i will have to double those to 4% and 6%.\r\n\r\nSo there might be a bug on your software or is there something i can do to fix that?\r\n\r\nOtherwise very happy with the pedals!\r\n\r\nPs.\r\nAlso when setting deadzone in the software and looking brake KGs when input start, it changes slightly after i hit \"save\".\r\nThis is not as big deal, but thought you should know.\r\n\r\nLike if my deadzone is 5% with 50kg, before i hit save, input starts to come after like 4.5kg or so, but after i hit \"save\", the force needed is lower like 3.5-.\r\n\r\n-Keijo Vinni\r\n\r\n\r\nLähetettyOutlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n\r\n",
