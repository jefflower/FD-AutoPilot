  "description_text": "Greetings,\n\nI hoe this message finds you well. I’m writing to inquire about the status of the order number above. I was curious if the inclusion of the VAM Haptic Reactor set has delayed processing? I noticed that the VAM Pro set mentioned  a release date of June 16th, with no mention of a release date for the VAM set. I presumed that they were already available.\n\nPlease advise if the VAM Haptic Reactor set in my order has caused a delay in the processing of my order.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nJulio C. Chacon, Jr.\nj_c_chacon_jr @hotmail.com\n\nSent from my iPhone",
