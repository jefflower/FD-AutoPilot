  "description_text": "Thank you for your message.\n\nI would like to clarify whether the SIMSONN ProX Ultra control box is also compatible with the standard SIMSONN ProX pedals—specifically, whether I can connect throttle, brake, and clutch to it.\nIf that is the case, I would be very interested in upgrading to the newer control box in order to take full advantage of the VAM Pro's capabilities.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not clear during the purchase process that the original ProX control box does not support the VAM Pro's full functionality.\nSince I specifically purchased the vibration motors to explore their potential, this limitation was unexpected.\n\nFor context: I had ordered the motors as a test product to gather hands-on experience for my SimRacing webshop SimWelten.de.\nI planned to share my insights with customers and was considering adding the motors to our product portfolio based on performance and integration.\n\nI would appreciate your feedback regarding the control box compatibility and whether an upgrade path is available.\n\nBest regards\n\nTobias Hoffer\n\nSimWelten.de\n\nservice@simsonn.com <service@simsonn.com> schrieb am Dienstag, 29.

I previously used the Simagic HPM Haptic – which looks very similar to the VAM Pro – but in my opinion, it felt significantly more powerful. Another issue I’m facing, especially in LMU, is that some effects get stuck. For example, when I brake into a corner, the ABS feedback kicks in and then just keeps running, even when it shouldn't. On top of that, I barely feel any difference between 20% and 100% power settings on the VAM Pro. All of this unfortunately affects the overall experience for me.\n>>\n>> This review was automatically published.
