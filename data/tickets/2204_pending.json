  "description_text": "Ariel,\r\n\r\nIt seems there was some changes that were not informed us in the last order we got.\r\nI have attached the photos for the materials that were supposed to be shipped with the P3 and P2 pedals.\r\nI see the control box is upgraded, but the springs are missing, and it was added damping blocks and throttle/clutch springs.\r\n\r\nCan you please confirm the changes and provide the correct photos? This is causing confusion to my customers who are complaining about the missing springs.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nPaulo Franca\r\nWyfort Electronics, Sales Director\r\n[cid:image001.jpg@01DC02FD.06D5D250]\r\nUSA: +1 949 508 0061\r\nhttp://www.wyfort.com<http://www.wyfort.com/>\r\n\r\n\r\n",
