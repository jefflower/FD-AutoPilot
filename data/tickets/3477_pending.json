Mostly because I am currently using a T-LCM pedal\r\nset, as I believe many people are, and your pedals would represent the\r\nperfect upgrade.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in sending me a review copy, please note that I am\r\nbased in Germany, and my full details are below.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\nPaul Ekert\r\nSchlehdornweg 6\r\nBraunschweig\r\n38122\r\nGermany\r\n\r\n+49 1578 731 1894\r\n\r\n",
