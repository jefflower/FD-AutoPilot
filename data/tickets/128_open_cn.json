It has been 2 months since I\\r\\ncontacted you, and my problem has not been solved.\\r\\nIf there is no progress in the next 24 hours, I'll just take my loss and\\r\\nbuy another pedals but I'll go public in any possible way (Reddit, Facebook\\r\\ngroups, Discord, YouTube...etc), and I'll make sure that I reach as much\\r\\npeople as I can to let them know about this experience and how hard it is\\r\\nto solve small issues, so I can't even imagine how it would be for bigger\\r\\nones.\\r\\nI do not think this is fair to me as a customer. This is such a small issue\\r\\nthat prevents me from using my pedals in the way I enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest regards!\\r\\nVlado Vrlika\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Fri, Jan 23, 2026 at 1:08 AM Vlado Vrlika <vvrlika@gmail.com> wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Hello,\\r\\n>\\r\\n> on November 27.
