  "description_text": "Hi,\r\nI recently placed an order and recieved everything I requested. However I\r\nover looked that when I purchased my pedals a while back they are\r\nequivalent to your plus model and not the pro model. I like the hydraulic\r\nthat comes with the pro, so my question is, can I order the mounting plate\r\nand possibly the load cell if it is different for the brake from model to\r\nmodel. Any direction on this as I would prefer not to upgrade the whole\r\npedal and would like to refrain from a return if needed and still help\r\nsupport your awesome products.\r\nThanks\r\nKyle\r\n\r\n",
