  "description_text": "Hey there, I got my pedals setup yesterday and the throttle has absolutely\r\nno input. The brake and clutch are both perfect. I've got the software\r\nupdated, I've tried changing usb ports, unplugging and replugging, nothing\r\nis working. Im not sure if there's something I can check myself before\r\nsending them back, hopefully I've simply overlooked something. Thanks for\r\nyour help!\r\n\r\n",
