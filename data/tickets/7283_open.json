Additionally, if the device frequently disconnects, it may be caused by a grounding issue with the pedal. You can refer to the following methods to check and resolve the problem.            If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals.
