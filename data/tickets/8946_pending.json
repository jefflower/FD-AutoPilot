      "body_text": "Hi Michael Beers,  Many modern motherboards continue to supply power to the USB ports even after the computer is shut down. As a result, the pedals remain powered on, and since the pedals cannot detect whether the computer is turned off, they will continue to operate. To completely power off the pedals, you need to turn off the power at the computer’s wall outlet or power strip switch. ",
