  "description_text": "Greetings Simsonn, I wasn’t planning to reach out, I was on my PC today in\r\nthe office and came across your website, but after seeing how much effort\r\nyou’re putting into growing it, I felt I should share what I saw. You’ve\r\nbuilt something with real potential but it seems some of your investment is\r\ngoing in the wrong direction, you are spending on what is not important,\r\nreaching people who aren’t your ideal audience.\r\n\r\nA small adjustment in focus could make a big difference and reveal the real\r\nvalue of what you’ve built and BOOM out the result you want.\r\n\r\nMind if I explain what I noticed and how to fix it?\r\n\r\n– marvellous\r\n\r\n",
