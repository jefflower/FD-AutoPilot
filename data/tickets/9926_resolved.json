It has lights but nothing happens in simsonn manager when I press the brake. Both Clutch and throttle are working.\r\n\r\nI have tried plugging the brake into the clutch and throttle ports on the control box and still not working.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me soon. My purchase is detailed below.\r\n\r\n[cid:90ce78f3-142f-41e7-8516-d8e3473819da]\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nYouseph\r\n\r\n",

If the issue persists, please record a video and share it with us via Google Drive, making sure the link access is set to viewable, so we can further analyze and assist you.",
