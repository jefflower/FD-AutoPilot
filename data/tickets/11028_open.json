If you could please send a return\r\nlabel I’d appreciate it.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Jordan Jones,    If the brake feels too stiff with the red damper, you can remove the 10mm travel limiter/spacer inside the black brake spring. This will increase the brake travel and make the pedal feel easier to control.  Also, during normal use, you don’t need to press the brake all the way to the bottom every time. Simply recalibrate the pedals in SIMSONN Manager and follow the calibration process, pressing the pedal with a comfortable, reasonable force. After calibration, you should be able to achieve effective braking with normal pedal pressure.",
