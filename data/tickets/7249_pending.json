  "description_text": "Hey Simsonn Team!\r\n\r\n\r\nI get it, you're super busy, so I'll cut right to the chase!\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m Will , a software engineer at Google and a UGC creator, and I'm super\r\npassionate about the tech/software/AI tools niche. I've created UGC for 60+\r\nbrands and generated 3M+ views for my clients!\r\n\r\n\r\nI came across Simsonn and genuinely love what you’re building - as a sim\r\nracing fan I can already picture a few creative directions to showcase your\r\nhigh-quality, affordable gear: in-sim POVs that sell the authentic\r\nmotorsports feel, concise setup and compatibility guides, dynamic unboxings\r\nthat highlight craftsmanship, and short performance demos that resonate\r\nwith racers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, here's my portfolio: *williampnguyen.com/portfolio*\r\n<http://williampnguyen.com/portfolio>\r\n\r\n\r\nWould love to continue the conversation and get right to work :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nWill\r\n\r\n",
