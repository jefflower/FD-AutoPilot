  "description_text": "Hello! I updated the firmware to version 2.1.2 and my pedals are no longer\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThe update process went like this: First, I tried updating the software\r\nthrough the app itself. However, after downloading and updating, my\r\ninterface became glitchy and transparent. I had to restart the app. This\r\nhad happened before, but this time, the software didn't update and the\r\nversion remained the same. Then I downloaded the new SIMSONN\r\nManager-2.1.2-Setup.zip driver from the official website. I unzipped the\r\narchive and launched the application from the new archive. After that, the\r\nUSB connection disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the cable is disconnected and reconnected, the LED backlight lights up\r\nfor a few seconds and Windows plays a sound notification indicating the\r\ndevice is connected. The device is detected in Task Manager. However, the\r\nsoftware shows that the pedals are still disabled. In Windows devices, the\r\npedals are working in the Axes properties, and there is movement of the\r\naxes when pressing the pedals. Windows also correctly displays the device\r\nas a gaming device.\r\nPressing the update button on the pedals turns on the red backlight, and\r\nthe program displays that the button is enabled. (Screenshot attached.)\r\nI tried installing software versions 2.0.9, 2.1.0, but the situation does\r\nnot change.\r\n\r\nTo test, I connected the pedals to another computer and installed software\r\nversion 2.1.2, but the pedals still don't work.\r\nI tried disconnecting the pedals from the hub, reinstalling different\r\nversions of the software with the upgrade button enabled and disabled. The\r\nresult is always the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, one LED module on the left brake pedal has been malfunctioning from\r\nthe very beginning. It keeps working while the others are static.\r\n\r\nThe pedals were purchased on December 8, 2024 on Aliexpress.\r\nThank you and I hope for a quick response.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nKostiantyn Moskal\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Kostiantyn Moskal,     Please uninstall the old version of SIMSONN Manager from your PC and install the latest version, SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2.  If the software already shows “SIMSONN Flasher Mode,” the device is already in update mode. If not, press the upgrade button on the control box and reconnect the USB cable—the device will then enter update mode automatically.  Once in update mode, please update the firmware manually via: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu  After the firmware update is complete, set the Offset first, then recalibrate the pedals to finish the setup.",
