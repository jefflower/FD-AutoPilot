  "subject": "Sequential Shifter Not Returning to Center – Replacement Request",
  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you’re doing well and happy holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a sequential shifter from Simsonn on September 30,\r\n2025, along with pedals and a handbrake. I’m currently experiencing an\r\nissue where the sequential shifter does not return to center after shifting\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve spoken with a couple of friends who are using the same Simsonn\r\nsequential shifter, and they are encountering the same issue as well. This\r\nleads me to believe it may be a hardware-related problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask if there is a way to have the shifter swapped out or\r\nreplaced. I’d be happy to provide any additional information, order\r\ndetails, or troubleshooting steps if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and support. I appreciate your help and\r\nlook forward to your response.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDamien\r\n\r\n",
