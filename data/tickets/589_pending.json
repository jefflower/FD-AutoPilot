  "description_text": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI bought a set of pedal pro plus and enjoyed the pedals very much, but\r\nthere is a little issue regarding the input in game and in the software\r\ncalibration. There are some input spikes when pressing the pedals (Brake\r\nand Throttle in my case), like spikes related to grounding issues. I' ve\r\nchecked the wire ground to the module controller, and it is ok!..Using the\r\nSoftware manager 1.8.0 (tried to use Software v4 calibration tool but there\r\nis a huge deadzone and imprecise input). Can this issue be related to\r\nhardware or software? Is there any firmware update to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!\r\n\r\n",

It’s recommended to remove some of the paint at the contact point to ensure proper grounding with the metal surface.  Also, are you using a Fanatec or Simagic base? These bases can sometimes cause interference with other devices. To improve stability, it's best to ensure that both the base and the PC are properly connected to the household ground. With proper grounding, the signal should remain stable without fluctuations.",
