      "body_text": "Hi Brayden,    Thank you for reaching out to us.  To answer your question, the Plus X P2-H2 does not come with a baseplate for mounting the pedals included by default. The baseplate is an additional optional accessory that can be purchased separately. If you do not select the baseplate option, you will only receive the pedals without a mounting base.  If you would like to add the baseplate to your order, please let us know, and we’ll be happy to assist you with that.  Thank you for your understanding. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!",
