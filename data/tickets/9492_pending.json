They just showed up today and I have a question about \r\nwhether or not the product I ordered should have included the base \r\nplate? From the listing and the pictures it certainly looks like it should.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of what I received.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know. If I received the correct product and your \r\nadvertising shows the base plate in the picture and makes no mention of \r\nthat fact they are for sure getting returned.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-Rich\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\n      Rich Gunthert\r\n\r\nOwner / Managing Member\r\n\r\nBlaze It Firewood Products, LLC\r\n\r\n\t(615) 522-9238 <tel:16155551212>\r\n\r\n\trich@blazeitfirewood.com <mailto:test@bif.com>\r\n\r\n\twww.blazeitfirewood.com <//www.bif.com>\r\n\r\n\t275 Old Natchez Trace Trail,  Camden, TN 38320\r\n\r\n",
