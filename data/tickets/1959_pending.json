I installed the motors according to instructions, but the pedals will not plug into the box.  However, they do plug into the old box.  But now my haptics are not working, even after using the Manager software.  What am I missing to get my haptic motors to work?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJames Waring\r\nOrder #SSN2043\r\n\r\n",
