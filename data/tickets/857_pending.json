      "body_text": "Hi A Lampen,    We had previously considered the installation of the clutch, but admittedly, it doesn't look very elegant and there's a chance the motor might be stepped on by mistake. If the vibration feels too strong during use, feel free to adjust the vibration frequency and intensity for a more comfortable experience.  I’ll contact our sales team to send you a clutch mounting bracket as soon as possible. Thank you very much for your support of our products!",
