I did that 2 or 3 times and it completed.. next time I start it asks me to do the update again:\n\nI think there is something wrong with the control box.. because VAM did not work and this strange update behavior..\nlet me know if you need some more infos etc.\n\nBest regards\n\nMatthias lang\nMartin-kink-str. 5\nAustria-6890 Lustenau",

      "body_text": "Hi Matthias. lang, Please press the upgrade button on the ProX control box, then reconnect the USB cable. This will put the controller into recovery mode. Open SIMSONN Manager 2.0.8, and navigate to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → Firmware → pedals → prox.sfu to manually update the ProX firmware. After the update, please test the motor again. We also recommend downloading and using SimHub version 9.9.3 for optimal compatibility. There is a small bug with that update prompt — you don't need to click it. Please just ignore it.",
