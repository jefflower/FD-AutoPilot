  "description_text": "Good evening,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to send this email to ease my own mind, as I had placed an order for sim pedals on December 31st, and the website said I would receive a text/email with updates but haven’t received anything at the time of sending this email. I assume that with the holidays and everything that it probably affects things, however I had ordered the rest of my rig from other sites and got confirmations within 30 minutes so I just wanted to follow up and make sure everything was okay on both ends. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nJeremiah McLean\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
