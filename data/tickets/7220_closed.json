  "description_text": "Hi team,\r\n\r\nI had purchased Simsonn Plus X Pedals with the VAM Pro Linear Motors on\r\nNovember 19, 2025 through your store on Aliexpress (Order\r\nID:8207000543300377).\r\n\r\nIt arrived a few days ago and I have set them up, but when I boot up the\r\nSimsonn software, the pedals are not detected. I have tried countless ways\r\nto try to troubleshoot, but nothing has worked.\r\n\r\nI have tried to troubleshoot by doing the following:\r\n\r\n   - Restarting my PC\r\n   - Uninstalled/downloaded/redownloaded Simsonn Manager 2.0.9 and 2.1.2\r\n   - Tried leaving the power supply for the VAM Pro unplugged and plugged\r\n   - Tried different USB ports\r\n   - Tried different USB cables\r\n\r\nNothing seems to be working and I suspect that it may be because of the\r\ncontrol box.\r\n\r\nI don't wish to return the product as it is very high quality, so I am\r\nhoping that the team can help me further troubleshoot the issue. Perhaps\r\nsend me a new control box to see if that fixes the issue and I can send the\r\nold one back.\r\n\r\nThank you and please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nJimmy\r\n\r\n",
