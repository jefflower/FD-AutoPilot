      "body_text": "Hi Javier Tellez,    First, please make sure you are using a USB 3.0 (blue) port, and avoid connecting the device through a USB hub. Additionally, please refer to the link below and use any wire to connect the computer case to a screw on the controller box. You may also connect any screw on the controller box to any screw on the pedal.  The reason for this is that some computer cases are not properly grounded to the household earth, which may cause grounding issues and affect device stability.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
