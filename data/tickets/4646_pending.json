I received the Simson Pro X with two pedals and with out the baseplate(see the picture), but I ordered the Newest Simsonn Pedal Pro X Ultra-PH2-H2 with Haptics and RGB Feedback and with baseplate.\r\nWas this the wrong delivery?\r\nThank you in advance. \r\nGoodbye, \r\nKamil Schütz \r\nYahoo Mail: Suchen, organisieren, erobern\r\n",
