  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nSince installing my Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedals last week, I have been \r\nhaving an issue keeping them responding.  I am using iRacing, and can \r\ndisconnect and reconnect the controller module from the computer to \r\nrestart them and they will work for a session, however when I leave the \r\nsession, after just a few minutes (5?), when I launch another session in \r\niRacing the pedals will not be recognized in either iRacing or the \r\nSimsonn Manager application until I disconnect and reconnect the \r\ncontroller box.\r\n\r\nIf this cannot be resolved, I will want to return the pedals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeff Hanisch\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Jeff Hanisch,   This issue is usually caused by insufficient USB power. Please plug the pedal directly into the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your computer, and avoid using a USB hub. Also, make sure that both your computer and the base are properly grounded—that is, the plug or power strip should be connected to a three-prong wall outlet. ",
