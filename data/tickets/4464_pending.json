  "description_text": "Hello, I am a novice simracer. I often sit and choose the best components\r\nfor my future setup. And recently I found your peripherals such as pedals,\r\ngearbox, steering wheel, handbrakes. It's incredible, the gearbox looks\r\nvery cool, the pedals don't look cool, but also the best thing I basically\r\nwanted. The steering wheel also left positive emotions. And I noticed that\r\nalmost everything I want to collect for my setup. It consists of your\r\nperipherals, and I wondered if you had a steering base. In one of the\r\nvideos, I saw a steering base setup in a proprietary application from\r\nsimsonn, and I started looking. I found your official website and saw the\r\nsteering base section. It said that it was still undergoing testing and the\r\ndevelopment phase. And I was wondering how long I should wait. I thought it\r\nwould be nice to make a complete setup from your company. Can you at least\r\ntell me approximately when your steering base could be expected to go on\r\nsale? Thank you in advance for your reply, and good luck in creating a\r\nsteering base.\r\n\r\n",
