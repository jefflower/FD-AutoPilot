It seems the package has not moved\r\nfrom its original location still and I am just wondering if you have any\r\nupdates as to when they may be shipped out?\r\nI fully understand these things take time and I am in no way rushing or\r\nexpecting anything to change, but if you have any update at all that would\r\nbe greatly appreciated!\r\nThank you in advance for your time\r\n\r\n-Regards,\r\n\r\nCharles Campanella\r\n1317 Warren drive\r\nBrunswick, Ohio 44212\r\n(440) 202-0685\r\n\r\n",
