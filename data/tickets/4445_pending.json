Both PlusX and ProX Ultra support vibration feedback interfaces, while the Ultra version features LED lighting, 16-bit resolution, and 8-level damping adjustment. You can choose the one that best suits your personal preference. ",

      "body_text": "Hi La nuova Terra,    Our pedals can also be used without the rubber or hydraulic dampers, relying solely on springs if you prefer.  The hydraulic damper mainly provides data buffering, stabilizing the pedal signal and enhancing the realistic travel feel.  The rubber damper adds secondary braking resistance and muscle memory, supporting nine different pressure curves for precise pedal tuning.     The pedal model you mentioned has a simpler design, but it can’t match our product’s feel, stability, and accuracy.  In addition, our system supports vibration feedback and telemetry, fully compatible with our SIMSONN haptic motors for a more immersive driving experience.",
