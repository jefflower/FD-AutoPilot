  "description_text": "Hello Simpsonn employee! I recently been having wire disconnecting\r\nproblems, and was wondering if there’s anywhere I can buy replacement wires\r\nfor the throttle?\r\nIt seems that whenever the angle of the wire coming out of the box is too\r\nsharp it will put in a signal at 100% throttle pressure.\r\nIs there anything I can do? I’ve been using these original pedals for years\r\nand they amazing!!\r\nThank you so much for the awesome pedals so far!\r\n\r\n",
