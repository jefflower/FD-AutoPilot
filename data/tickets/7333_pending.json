  "description_text": "I purchased the 3 haptic reactors as well as the pro plus x controller that\r\nwas necessary for the haptics. upon delivery i realized that the pedal\r\ncables didnt fit in the pro x controller so i would have to run both\r\nsimultaneously to be able to get haptics however my simsonn software does\r\nnot like when i plug the second box in with the haptics and it sends my\r\ndevice into a \"simsonn flasher\" state in which my \"main controller is in\r\nupgrade mode, check if the upgrade button is released and reconnect the usb\r\nto exit\" i have tried in every which order of that button being pressed in,\r\nout, etc but the pedals are only recognized if i press the upgrade button\r\nand reconnect my original controller without the haptics the moment i plug\r\nmy haptics controller usb in it is back to the flasher mode. any solutions?\r\ni dont want to have to return these\r\n\r\n-- \r\n-- \r\n\r\n*1x Grammy Award Winning Producer*\r\n*Contact: *\r\n*  Phone:* *(619)-733- <619%29-988-2716>1398*\r\n*  Email: georgedavidlee@gmail.com <officialskitzobeatz@gmail.com>*\r\n  *Instagram: @dontbeangrywithgeorge*\r\n\r\n*Production credit must be issued to \"Curious George\" - (BMI)*\r\n\r\n   *This e-mail and any files or data transmitted with it are confidential\r\nand intended solely for the use of the individual named above.
