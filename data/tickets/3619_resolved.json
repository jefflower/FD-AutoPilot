      "body_text": "Good afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe sequential shifter worked perfectly as soon as I reset it and returned\r\nthe key to the normal position. However, the handbrake didn't. I went\r\nthrough the process and updated the software manually, but the Simsonn\r\nsoftware doesn't recognize the handbrake after the process.\r\n\r\nI repeated the process a few times, but it still isn't recognized by\r\nSimsonn. When I go to the Windows connected devices menu, it appears as a\r\nconnected device, but the axes don't move.\r\n\r\nI've included some screenshots below showing both being recognized in\r\nWindows, but only the sequential one in the Simsonn software.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your support.\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\nWindows Device Manager\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\nSimsonn Software\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nEm qui., 9 de out. de 2025 às 11:55, service@simsonn.com <\r\nservice@simsonn.com> escreveu:\r\n\r\n> Hi Lucas Lino,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> First, please make sure that both the handbrake and sequential shifter are\r\n> connected *directly to the rear USB3.0 port (blue)* on your PC — do not\r\n> use a USB hub.\r\n> If the USB power supply is stable, please follow the steps below to\r\n> restore the device:\r\n>\r\n>    1.
