  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with my pedals. I use the van pro haptics but the break\r\nand throttle pickup up a signal every time the motors are activated. I\r\nalready connected the grounding wire to the break which made it a little\r\nbetter but it's not solved.\r\n\r\nWithout grounding wire and haptics at 30% - break will jump to 60-70% with\r\ngrounding wire still to 30%.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do? I got the black ones is the grounding not\r\nworking properly because of the color?\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with the pedals but can't use the haptics as is ATM.\r\n\r\nAny quick fixes would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nRoman\r\n\r\n",
