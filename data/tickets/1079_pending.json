      "body_text": "Hi Thomas Celant,    You can connect the green grounding wire to the silver screw post near the brake sensor. To do this, loosen one of the M6 screws, insert the spring terminal of the green wire into the gap between the screw and the bracket, and then tighten the screw to secure it.  This issue is typically caused by using a Fanatec wheelbase along with a PC or wall outlet that lacks proper grounding, which can lead to static interference or electrical instability.",
