  "description_text": "Hey there,\n\nI've recently stumbled upon your products while looking to upgrade my pedals.\nI'm currently on SRP Lite's and they were good at the start but I need something better and more precise now.\n\nI have a few questions about the Simsonn Plus X and Pro X pedals.\n\nFirst of all: I'm not really that deep into all the specifications and stuff, so I wanted to ask what exactly the difference on them is, aside from the lightning on the Pro X?\n\nSecondly I wanted to ask, where the products are getting shipped from and would you know if I had to pay import fees or any other kind of fee at the arrival of the product in Germany?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nBest Regards,\nElia Liberatore\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Elia Liberatore,  Pro X Ultra and Plus X are our two latest pedals. The Pro X Ultra pedal is Simsonn's flagship product, featuring an adjustable hydraulic damper and more advanced electronic components within the control unit. It delivers precise control, making it ideal for experienced players seeking fine-tuned adjustments. Equipped with an RGB system that provides feedback based on in-game telemetry data, it boasts a more aesthetically pleasing lighting design and form factor to enhance the overall atmosphere. However, should these features be unnecessary, the Plus X pedal offers superior value for money – employing the same high-quality elastomer, a 200kg sensor, and equally robust construction.     Additionally, the product ships from China, but you won't have to pay any customs duties.",
