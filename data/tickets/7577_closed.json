  "description_text": "Hello, my pedals from order #SSN4353 are missing the baseplate completely, and the brake pedal makes a very loud noise. It sounds like metal is hitting metal, coming from the damper. Is this normal? If so, I would like to cancel the purchase. Alternatively, I would like a new set of pedals where the brake pedal doesn't make this noise.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Sven Hoffmann\r\n\r\n\r\nVon meinem/meiner Galaxy gesendet\r\n\r\n\r\n",
