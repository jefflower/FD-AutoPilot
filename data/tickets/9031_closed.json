I also need to return order #SSN4530 as it has been delivered and since I will be returning the pedals, I no longer have any need for the base.\r\n\r\nAlso I have still yet to receive the rest of order SSN4334 that I paid for three weeks ago.  The tracking number that I was able to track down after being told that there were two separate shipments has shown the exact same status for over a week now.  I have also asked for an update on this before and still haven't received any update as to the status.  I'm at the point of reporting this as a fraudulent purchase to my credit card company if I don't hear anything.  I don't want to do that, but I'm honestly being left no other choice.\r\n\r\nMichael Shreve\r\n16120 35th Park SE\r\nBothell, WA, 98012\r\nmichael.shreve@comcast.net\r\n\r\n",
