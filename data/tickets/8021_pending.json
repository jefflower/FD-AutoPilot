  "description_text": "\r\n Dear Ladies and Gentleman, \r\n \r\n Unfortunatly I have a problem with my VAM Pro Haptic Motor. One motor is noticable more weaker than the other. With the same settings in the SIMSONN Manager and in Simhub one motor is about 30% of the strength of the other. I tested all three interfaces at the controller but on motor is much weaker then the other. \r\n So please tell me how can I fix the problem. If this doesn't works it would be super kindful if you send me a new one, cause the diffrence is massive between the two VAM Pro motors. If one is at 100% the weaker is barely noticeably. \r\n \r\n Order #SSN3729 \r\n \r\n Best regards, \r\n David Reifinger \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
