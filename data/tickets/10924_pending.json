      "body_text": "Hi Jimmy Secreet,  Does your Simagic pedal set have a dedicated port/connector for a haptics module? If it doesn’t, you can purchase a PlusX control box + power supply and use our control box specifically for telemetry/haptics output, while the Simagic pedals continue to handle the pedal input signals. This way, both systems can run independently without interfering with each other. ",
