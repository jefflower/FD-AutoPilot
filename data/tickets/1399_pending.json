They're connected in\r\nSimHub Manager, but SimHub says \"searching device.\"\r\n\r\nCan you help me? Here are the screenshots.\r\n\r\n[image: WhatsApp Image 2025-07-09 at 23.26.51.jpeg]\r\n[image: WhatsApp Image 2025-07-09 at 23.26.40.jpeg][image: WhatsApp Image\r\n2025-07-09 at 23.26.39.jpeg]\r\n\r\n",
