Is this something you can help me with? I have tried things I’ve found online, I’m ensure I’m using a direct 3.0 use at my computer. Software has been updated. If I disconnect USB and reconnect it works but stops after a few laps. I saw somewhere that I may need a ground wire but not sure where I would ground it to? Any advice would be great. \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n> ",

You sent that to me no problem. Them once set up the haptics did not function at all. I am left with a Simsonn flasher error. I had tried multiple things like updating the unit along with manually updating. I email Simsonn about this issue and i was told to ground the unit. I connected a ground wire to the control box and then to my computer housing as instructed. After this the pedals did work however they continued to shut off after 30-60 min of play. So, I moved to a slightly larger wire (the wire I originally used was tiny) i connect to the exact same spot and at the same time mounted the controller directly to the bottom of my rig so that it was ground out there also. Since i have moved the ground, I continue to get the Simsonn flasher error. I really want these to work; I don't want to be asking for a refund. What can i do to make these work. I have also found that every time they would turn off  I could get them to work by disconnecting the signal USB and reconnecting. This is no longer working. \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n> ",

      "body_text": "Hi Ryon Remmers,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
