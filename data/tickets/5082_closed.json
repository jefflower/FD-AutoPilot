When more than two effects are enabled in\r\nSimHub, the haptic motors lose connection — it switches from “Connected” to\r\n“Searching Device.” After that, the motors keep vibrating without stopping,\r\nand I have to unplug all cables and power to reset everything.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the motors can’t handle more than two simhub effects at once\r\n. Could you please check if this problem will be fixed in a future update\r\nor if there is a fixe ?\r\n\r\nI read other people having the same issue on reddit website. So I presume\r\nyou are aware of this problem.\r\n\r\nI really like the hardware, but this issue makes it difficult to enjoy the\r\nexperience\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n",

You mentioned two effects in SimHub — could you tell us which ones exactly, and in which game you experienced this issue? Have you tried running SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 alone for telemetry without SimHub?  Please make sure that your pedal’s USB cable is connected directly to a rear USB 3.0 (blue) port, not through a USB hub, as insufficient power could cause disconnections. Try turning off all lighting on the ProX Ultra and test again with SimHub — if the disconnects stop, that confirms it’s a power supply issue.  Also, please share the Reddit post link you mentioned so we can review it. If the issue appears to come from SimHub, please send us a compressed copy of the log folder from your SimHub installation directory — we’ll work with the SimHub team to investigate and resolve it.",

If your PC and wheelbase are properly grounded, the main controller and pedals are connected with the green grounding wire, and the VAM Pro motors are mounted with nylon screws and washers, then it’s likely that the main controller is faulty.

From a design perspective, it’s best to connect them together to improve USB transmission stability and reduce interference. Have you tried connecting them and performing a test? I’ve already informed our hardware team to investigate this issue.      Hello,  update 2     I performed some continuity tests on my Simsonn control box and noticed something interesting:  When I touch two screws on the metal case, I get continuity (beep) — meaning the case is properly conductive.  However, when I touch the metal frame of the USB port and one of the case screws, there is no continuity.     This means that the USB shield is not connected to the chassis ground.  If that’s the case, the USB port housing is floating electrically, which could explain why the box loses USB connection randomly due to EMI or ground potential differences.     I also read a Reddit post from another user who found the same issue.  He said he solved it by adding a small wire (soldered somewhere inside the box) to connect the USB port shield to the metal case — but he clearly mentioned it was “at your own risk”.     Please be sure to also read my previous message.      I did all my best. ?",

Grounding tests already performed*\r\n\r\nI soldered a grounding wire inside the control box, from the scraped metal\r\narea to the USB port shell, to ensure the USB port is properly grounded to\r\nthe chassis.\r\n\r\nI also added multiple additional grounding wires on my rig, in every\r\nconfiguration possible.\r\nThese grounding tests *did improve the situation*, but they did *not* fix\r\nthe problem completely.\r\n------------------------------\r\n*2. Position tests of the control box*\r\n\r\nThis part is important:\r\n\r\n   - When the Simsonn box is mounted *under my rig* → I get frequent USB\r\n   disconnections.\r\n   - When I place the control box *in front of the rig*, as far as possible\r\n   (around 20 cm away), I can sometimes play for 1–2 days without any issue.\r\n   - But eventually, even in this “best position”, the box still\r\n   disconnects randomly — including during online races, which is a big\r\n   problem for competitive use.\r\n\r\nSo the only improvement I found was *moving the control box far away from\r\nthe rig*, but this solution is not stable and not reliable.\r\n------------------------------\r\n*3. Other devices never disconnect*\r\n\r\nEvery other USB device on my system is perfectly stable.\r\n*Only the VAM Pro pedals disconnect.*\r\nThis makes me think the issue may come from the control box or the USB\r\ncable itself.\r\n------------------------------\r\n*4. Conclusion*\r\n\r\nAfter testing every possible grounding method and every possible position\r\nfor the control box, I am starting to believe that the *USB cable and/or\r\nthe internal EMI protection of the Simsonn box might not be sufficient* in\r\nmy case.\r\n\r\nI am honestly out of solutions at this point, and I’m very disappointed\r\nbecause I really love the VAM Pro pedals and I don’t want to return them.\r\nI simply wish I could find a way to make the system 100% stable.\r\n\r\nThank you again for the replacement box, but the issue is still present.\r\nCould you please help me find a definitive solution?\r\n\r\nDo you plan to improve your control box to fix emi issues ?\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\nLe jeu. 6 nov. 2025, 15:24, Cayme <oxidia.music@gmail.com> a écrit :\r\n\r\n> Hello Team ,\r\n>\r\n> Thank you very much for sending the replacement control box .\r\n> I really appreciate it.\r\n> I’m currently waiting to receive it and will test it as soon as possible\r\n> once it arrives.\r\n>\r\n> If the new box still shows the same disconnection issue, I would\r\n> appreciate a video or image tutorial showing how to safely perform the USB\r\n> port modification you mentioned.\r\n>\r\n> Please note that I recently had surgery on November 3rd, so I won’t be\r\n> able to run tests or provide updates for a little while during my recovery.\r\n> I kindly ask that you keep my support ticket open even if I don’t reply\r\n> immediately in the coming days.\r\n>\r\n> Thank you again for your support and for forwarding this issue to your\r\n> hardware team.\r\n>\r\n> Best regards,\r\n> Cayme\r\n>\r\n> Le mer. 5 nov. 2025, 09:28, service@simsonn.com ",
