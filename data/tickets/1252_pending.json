  "description_text": "Hello I have the following product from yourselves  (  SIMSONN PC USB 7+R H Simulator Gear Shifter )\r\nBut I think the firmware has messed up, its only registering the following gears ( in game and in control panel )  - 1/3/4 and nothing else.\r\n\r\nI have tried using FreeJoy Configurator<https://github.com/FreeJoy-Team/FreeJoyConfiguratorQt> but had no luck fixing the issue.\r\nBy any chance you have a pre made firmware file I could use to reflash it.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated\r\nKind regards\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n\r\n",
