      "body_text": "Hi Steve Forrester,    Please provide your previous ticket number. Regarding the electromagnetic interference you reported, this is not an issue with the pedals themselves. It is mainly caused by interference from other Fanatec bases, or due to your home PC not using a three-prong socket with proper grounding, which results in poor or non-standard grounding. Our pedals have been thoroughly tested and confirmed to have no such issues.  If you test the pedals with the base turned off, they will function normally. This is why we have suggested solutions that have already been verified by other customers. In fact, we recommend having an electrician check whether your PC and base are properly grounded, as this is the root cause of the problem. Without proper grounding, static electricity may frequently build up in winter, affecting your PC and other racing USB devices. In our own tests with the Fanatec CLS DD 8Nm base, we also found that reliable grounding is essential. In addition, the issue may also be related to unstable USB power supply. We recommend connecting the pedals to the rear USB 3.0 port of your PC, and avoiding USB hubs without independent power supply.  Please note that insufficient grounding not only affects device stability, but also poses electrical safety risks. In extreme cases, electrical leakage could cause personal injury.  Based on the above, we can confirm that the device itself has no issues, so we do not recommend a return. We will continue to assist you in troubleshooting your setup to ensure safe and stable operation.",
