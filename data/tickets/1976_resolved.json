  "description_text": "Hi there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem continues.\r\n\r\nThe pc itself recognises the usb driver as simsonn hb pro. But yiur software does not recognise the handbrake at all. Now trying to to calibrate it and im unable due to this.\r\n\r\nI have tried ALL of your steps above including directly plugging only the handbrake into the pc. Even going through the extra expense of replacing the powered usb hub.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem that has occurred since day one as per the above trail. I managed to get it to recognise one and calibrate but now it wont let me do it again.\r\n\r\nI have tried on a separate pc as well with the same issue. The product is broken.\r\n\r\nPlease either preferably send me a new one, or refund this one in full including shipping costs.\r\n\r\nSent from Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Aaron Francis <aaron.francis.89@hotmail.com>\r\nSent: Friday, April 18, 2025 4:45:37 PM\r\nTo: General and sales enquiries <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSubject: Re: SSN1299 - faulty\r\n\r\nHi there, I got it working in the end.

Your problem could be due to insufficient power from the USB port. Please try connecting it to a USB 3.0 port or use a USB hub with independent power supply. Please connect the USB cable to the USB 3.0 port on the back of the computer. This port is usually blue. If the issue is still not resolved, please feel free to contact us, we will try our best to solve it.\r\n\r\nHere are the possible problems, you can check them one by one:\r\n\r\n1. Check if the USB is firmly plugged in. You can try another data cable or another computer.\r\n\r\n2.  is recommended to use the rear USB port on the motherboard to avoid insufficient power supply from the front or expansion port.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Check if the LED light on the control panel is on - if not, it may be a power supply problem.\r\n\r\n4. Are there multiple other USB devices plugged into a USB hub, causing overall power supply instability?\r\n\r\n5. Have you tested a USB hub with independent power supply?\r\n\r\n6. Check if the pedal device can be found in \"Game Controller\"\r\n\r\n7. Disable Windows' \"Power Management Turn Off USB Power Saving\" function (set in Device Manager → USB Root Hub → Power Management).\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nservice@simsonn.com\r\n\r\nFrom: Aaron Francis<mailto:aaron.francis.89@hotmail.com>\r\nDate: 2025-04-17 21:22\r\nTo: service@simsonn.com<mailto:service@simsonn.com>\r\nSubject: SSN1299 - faulty\r\nHo there.\r\n\r\nI received the handbrake today and have it installed i believe im either doing something wrong or the handbrake is faulty.\r\n\r\nAttached is a video.\r\n\r\nI have plugged into PC with the latest software.\r\n\r\nOpening simsonn manager does not recognise the handbrake\r\n\r\nPlease provide a solution\r\n\r\nThanks you\r\n\r\nSent from Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n\r\n",
