  "description_text": "Hello, i recently bought a PlusX 3 Pedal Set from you (ordered no 3061648848014112). During my first tests, i noticed the damper in the gas pedal has air trapped inside. I can hear it pumping air and it has a deadzone before it starts damping. Attached is a video where you can hear the \"pumping sound\". Could you send a replacement part please?",
