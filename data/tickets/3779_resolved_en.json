  "description_text": "Hello,\n\nI have the Pro-X pedals (including clutch) and have been having a problem for quite some time.\nSince no patch has been released yet, I wanted to report it to you.\n\nIn the Windows controller settings and in all games, an additional axis is displayed, but it does not remain stationary and constantly jumps back and forth. I have attached a picture.\n\nThe problem is that this makes it very difficult for me to assign buttons and axes, as this axis is constantly being recognized because it is permanently sending signals.\nAnd since this axis does not physically exist, it must be a software/firmware or hardware problem with the controller box.\n\nSoftware: Simsonn Manager 2.1.0\nFirmware controllbox: CPU1:v2.0.3 CPU2:v2.0.2\n\nI am curious to know whether you are already aware of this.\n\nKind regards,\nAndreas Kienle",

In the software, click Revert and then Save, and check whether the RX axis is disabled. If the issue is still not resolved, try a manual firmware update: Go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-prox.sfu. After completing the update, please test again.\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
