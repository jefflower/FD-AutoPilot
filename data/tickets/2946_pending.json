  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen buying the Plus X (\r\nhttps://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-plus-x-pedals?variant=51288365072698\r\n) with haptic reactor, do the motors need a different power supply or will\r\njust connect to the control box?\r\n\r\nAlso, when buying the 3 pedals, is it possible to only buy 2 haptic\r\nreactors (brake and throttle pedals)?\r\n\r\nWhere they will ship from? Buying from Portugal will there be any custom\r\ntaxes and/or paperwork?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJoão Oliveira\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Joao Oliveira, when you purchase the Haptics Reactors  Set, it includes a free power supply and European plug. However, when purchasing haptics separately, these are not included. You can purchase three pedals and a set of two Haptic Reactors on the Haptic Reactors page. We ship from our warehouse in Germany, and Haptic Reactors are shipped from China. No additional customs taxes and/or paperwork are required.",

What is the period of guarantee of the PlusX\r\npedals (and haptic reactors) and how can I use it if I need it.\r\n\r\nI read some messages about EMI, connection and control box problems that\r\nleft me (and my friends) concerned. We are trying to decide between Simsonn\r\nand SimJack and we are a bit divided.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any advantage of buying 3 or 4 sets of pedals together then\r\nbuying them individually? Is there any promotion code if we buy together a\r\nlarger number of pedals?\r\n\r\nThanks again for the support.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJoão Oliveira\r\n\r\nA sexta, 22/08/2025, 11:05, support@simsonn.com ",
