In the meantime, you can use the internal version of SimHub that I’ve provided. The official release is still undergoing testing and may take a bit more time.    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrSbAvCC5iyx9XgdRgSQV-hWpmDGkujc/view?usp=sharing     You also need to perform an Offset adjustment — please click the Offset button in the top right corner of the software. ",
