  "description_text": "\r\nDear Simsonn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI created a ticket already requesting to adjust my existing order so I can include 1 VAM pro for my brakes with the mounting bracket and a power supply unit. I still haven’t received a reply. I’m also not able to login into the simsonn support freshdesk because it isn’t letting me reset my password as it’s giving me the error “You are not authorised to access this portal. Kindly contact your helpdesk administrator.”  Even though I never created an account and if I click sign up it tells me an account already exist under my email address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please let me know as a reply to this email if you’ve received my email and if you can amend the order so I don’t have to pay shipping twice. I’d appreciate it a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nMarios\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
