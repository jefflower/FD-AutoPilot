  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a set of your rumble motors (VAM) through Amazon. One of the motors has unfortunately stopped working after a short period of use.\r\n\r\nBoth units worked initially, but one is now completely unresponsive, while the other continues to function normally. I have checked all wiring, connections, and settings to rule out installation or configuration issues.\r\n\r\nPlease advise on the appropriate next steps for warranty support or replacement. I can provide the Amazon order number, photos, or a video demonstrating the issue if needed.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nShannon Dottin\r\n",

Using an incorrect mode can quickly damage the VAM motor, especially when long-duration telemetry-based vibration effects are enabled, such as RPM or speed-related effects, which may cause overload and motor failure. Please make sure the correct mode is selected. There should be a clear indication on the mode selection button. ",
