  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n I placed an order for a pedal 6 days ago, on August 16, 2025 (Order Number: SSN2384). I saw on your website that production usually takes 1–2 days, but I haven’t received a shipping confirmation yet. \r\n Could you please let me know if my order is still in production or if there has been any issue? I’d appreciate a quick update on the current status. \r\n Thank you in advance for your support. \r\n Best regards, Fabian Zagler \r\n \r\n\r\n",
