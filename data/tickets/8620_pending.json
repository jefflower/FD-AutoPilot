  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am contacting you regarding my order #SSN4544\r\n\r\nWhen I was placing the order, the information on the website indicated that\r\nthe item would be shipped from the *EU warehouse (Germany)*. However, I can\r\nsee from the tracking information that the package is actually being\r\nshipped from *China*.\r\n\r\nAs you know, shipping from Germany to Poland does not involve any\r\nadditional customs duties or VAT. Now that the package is coming from China\r\nand its value exceeds €150, I will be charged *23% Import VAT* and customs\r\nclearance fees by the courier in Poland (approximately 60-70 USD extra).\r\n\r\nSince I chose the EU shipping specifically to avoid these additional costs,\r\ncould you please clarify this situation? Will you reimburse me for the VAT\r\nand customs fees I will have to pay upon delivery?\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt response.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKamil Adamowski\r\n\r\n",
