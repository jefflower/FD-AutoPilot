As I'm\r\nlooking to purchase those and do not want to end up with 2 sets of 3 pedals.\r\n\r\nAre there 1, 2 or 3 pedals in there? Sorry I just couldn't find this info\r\non the site. In the picture there are 3 pedals yet in the dimensions tab,\r\nthose are for the springs? and the plate? It isn't clear anywhere exactly\r\nhow many pedals.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jul 8, 2025 at 1:29 PM service@simsonn.com ",
