  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Support Team,\n\nI’m having trouble registering my pedals and would like your assistance.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/23910970038552757\n\nI have a similar issue to the one shown in this video (referencing the same\nregistration steps). My setup uses the *Plus X Pedal Control Box*, and I\nfollowed the guidelines the image I attached. However, during the process I\nencountered an error message saying something like *“this is not an update\nfor pedal”*.\n\nAdditional details:\n\n   -\n\n   *SIMSONN Manager version:* 2.1.2\n   -\n\n   The manager can read my pedals without any problem, but I still cannot\n   complete the registration.\n\n   -\n\n   I am using VRAM Pro haptic as well\n\nCould you please advise on how to resolve this issue or let me know if\nthere’s anything else I should try?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nBest regards,\nFrancis\n\n[image: image.png]",
