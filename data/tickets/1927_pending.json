  "description_text": "Honestly they are garbage. I have 2 sets that do exactly the same thing.\r\nBoth on brand new pro x pedals.\r\n\r\nIssue.\r\n- your 24v power supply connector does not even fit into your network box.\r\nIt is extremely loose.\r\n- while racing you can feel it hit a frequency and just stay there. Even if\r\nyou shut off the sim and more importantly if you shut down your software.\r\n- when you unplug the power the shaker obviously stops. However when you\r\nplug it back in there is a large spark and they go back to shaking.\r\n- usb disconnected it continues to shake. So it’s not a signal coming from\r\nthe computer.\r\n- it now constantly kicks out the “upgrade” switch and the pedals can not\r\nbe used until I climb behind my rig and push the button back in then cycle\r\npower thru usb.\r\n\r\nAll of these issues started once the shakers were installed. Gas to 1.\r\nBrake to 2.\r\n\r\nAt this time I have them unplugged as I am ready to throw them against the\r\nwall. The box is not on the rig so it’s not a box vibration issue.  I\r\neither need a fix for this asap or I would like a refund for both sets I\r\nbought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jul 24, 2025 at 9:14 PM SIMSONN <no-reply@loox.io> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hello Anthony, We would be grateful if you shared how things look and\r\n> feel.

      "body_text": "Hi Warped Media,    First, please confirm from your picture that the SIMSONN Manager version is 2.0.9, and the firmware version is either 2.0.3 or 2.0.2, which is normal.  1st issue: The 24V power supply is manufactured by the power supplier. We recommend securing the power connector with a cable tie to prevent it from loosening due to rig movement.  2nd issue: Please ensure the firmware is updated to the latest version and that the USB cable is connected directly to the rear blue USB 3.0 port on your PC. Avoid using unpowered USB hubs, as insufficient power can cause frequent disconnections.  3rd issue: A spark when plugging in the power is normal. Even brands like Simagic experience this; it will not damage the device.  4th issue: This is similar to issue #2, mainly caused by unstable power supply or EMI interference from the wheelbase.  5th issue: The upgrade switch being triggered usually means the control box is not securely fixed or is being accidentally touched. Please ensure the control box is secured; this is a usage issue, not a design flaw.  Our devices themselves have no inherent quality problems. Most of these issues are caused by EMI interference and unreliable grounding in the home environment. I will also provide EMI troubleshooting recommendations because, in our testing environment, VAM Pro can run stably for days without stopping due to USB disconnection.       To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.          https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting     https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
