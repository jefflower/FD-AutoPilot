  "description_text": "Hello,     I'd like to return the steering wheel and the shifter. There isn't anything wrong with them, I just don't like how the shifter shifts. The steering wheel quick release doesnt work for my wheelbase (simagic alpha evo), I went with the neo x steering wheel instead. The quick release is not 6/4 like many of the other quick releases.     Thanks",
