Nobody ever reached out. So i want my money back for the haptics and the mounts or i want my items. But the pedals come in 2 weeks ago. So just wondering how i can get this resolved. Ive reached out countless times via email. And tried countless phone calls that wouldn't even go through. \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
