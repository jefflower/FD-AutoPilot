  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI Just received the Pro X Ultra pedals and during my setup I noticed that\r\nthere is one LED on the throttle pedal that is permanently stuck on Red,\r\neven if you turn off the lights in the software! (See attached photos) Is\r\nthere any way I can get a replacement throttle set out?\r\n\r\nI purchased on Nov 20th, 2025 on AliExpress. Order ID: 8206400752272432\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n",
