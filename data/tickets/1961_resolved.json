If your device is a PlusX, ProX, or ProX Ultra, please update the software to SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 and update the pedal firmware via the “Check for Updates” option in the settings menu. Once updated, you can use the Offset function to reset the offset to zero, which will automatically adjust the dead zone to the minimum edge based on the current pedal pressure. ",
