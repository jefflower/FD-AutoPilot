  "description_text": "Hello.  I bought the Simsonn pro x pedals.  And I was wondering if you had any insight on what the settings should be for iracing on dirt ? It seems like ever since I’ve had these pedals.  I have actually lost speed.  It’s like I cannot get any forward bite out of the car.  So I was wondering if possibly I need to change something in my settings for the pedals ? Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you so much! \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n",

Please analyze the issue based on your actual driving experience, and then fine-tune the pedals accordingly to achieve the feel and feedback that best match your driving style. ",
