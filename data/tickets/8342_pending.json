On my side, nothing\r\nappears, which is quite strange. I've checked, and I have version 2.1.2,\r\nand the firmware is up to date.\r\nDo you have any idea why I don't see the brake force displayed on my brake\r\npedal?\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\nRomain\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n",

Since the Pro X is already on the market, modifying its firmware could affect existing customers, so we have conducted additional testing. Please provide your order number so we can assist you further. ",
