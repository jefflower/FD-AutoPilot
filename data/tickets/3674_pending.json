The brake still works,\r\nand I tried using the grounding wire, however the throttle pedal input is\r\nnot recognized at all in the Simsonn software or in other places (games,\r\netc.). I've tried calibrating but nothing is being recognized.\r\n\r\nPlease help - thank you!\r\n\r\nCarlo\r\n\r\n",

Typically, the finger press will exert more force. Please provide two videos:    A video showing the signal changes when pressing the sensor directly with your finger.    A video showing the signal changes when pressing the pedal normally.    I will review these videos to help identify the issue.
