There was an angle deviation on a mid sheet-metal part for the HS Pro, so we asked the supplier to remake the parts, which caused the delay and a backlog of orders. We have now received the updated parts, production has resumed, and shipments are now going out in sequence. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Also, could you please share your order number ? We’ll check it right away and update you with the latest shipping status.",
