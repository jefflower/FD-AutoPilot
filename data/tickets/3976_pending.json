Apologies for the delay. \r\n \r\n Your shipment is held by Dutch Customs due to incorrect customs valuation. There seems to be a misunderstanding on how to correctly determine the customs value of goods in case\r\n for testing/samples. \r\n \r\n For customs valuation purposes, customs authorities will value test samples as if they had been bought/sold*. This means in your case the customs valuation will be higher than\r\n the 10,00 USD mentioned on the invoice. This will also lead to a higher customs debt in import duties and import VAT. \r\n \r\n Looking at the website of the supplier/shipper the fair price total value for these goods would be 676,00 USD: \r\n \r\n Simsonn Plus X Racing Simulation Pedal with Haptic Reactor Optional \r\nPLUS X P3-H3 SILVER WITH BASEPLATE 299,00 USD \r\nhttps://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-plus-x-pedals?variant=51288365072698 \r\n \r\n Simsonn Pro X Ultra Sim Racing Pedal with Haptic Reactor Optional \r\nPRO X ULTRA-P3-H3 WITH BASEPLATE 377,00 USD \r\nhttps://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-racing-sim-pedal-pro-x-ultra?variant=51308303974714 \r\n \r\n \r\n Can you please confirm whether or not you agree with above valuation?\r\nIt is also possible to return the goods to sender. \r\n \r\n We look forward to your reply. \r\n \r\n *The shipper selected for the customs debt to be paid by the consignee at the moment of shipping. It is possible for the shipper to financially take care of the customs debt\r\n (duty, taxes and brokerage charges) if he signs the attached Letter of Acceptance (of the charges) \r\n \r\n \r\n Met vriendelijke groet/Kind regards, \r\n \r\nHuu-Hiep Nguyen\r\n \r\nUPS Douanezaken | Customs Department \r\nBrokerage Specialist \r\nTel Brokerage + 31 (0) 40 2224648 \r\n Mail Brokerage :\r\nnlbrokerage@ups.com\r\n / douanezaken@ups.com \r\n \r\nDear Client, as of July 1th, 2021, there are significant changes to the European Union’s Value Added Tax (VAT) rules impacting imports into the EU valued up to €150.\r\n \r\n We are happy to advice you to prepare for this, more information can be found via the following link: \r\n https://www.ups.com/us/en/services/international-shipping/help-and-advice.page\r\n \r\n \r\n <image001.png> \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n From: Alex Reinholdsson <alexander.reinholdsson@gmail.com> \r\nSent: Tuesday, September 16, 2025 12:24 PM \r\nTo: Amandeep Kaur Nijar <akaurnijar@ups.com>; NL Brokerage <nlbrokerage@ups.com> \r\nSubject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: betreft factuur en betaalbewijs 1Z144AW70400437911-144AW737KTD\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Hi! \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n What does this mean for me?

Pro X Ultra is equipped with an adjustable hydraulic lever and is designed for experienced professional riders. The pedal features a lighting system that provides feedback based on game telemetry data,\r\n with more sophisticated lighting effects and styling. If these features are not required, the Plus \r\nWe have below a rough description of the upgrade points we have made to the pedal, and hopefully it will provide you with some ideas for your review shoot. \r\nOne of the most important upgrades is the braking system. We've introduced a completely redesigned elastomer unit: the red, yellow and blue elastomers have durometer ratings of 60, 70 and 80HA respectively, and have recommended maximum force limits of 60kg,\r\n 100kg and 140kg respectively, although in practice they're capable of withstanding much higher forces. The blue elastomers are fully capable of withstanding 200kg. A wide selection of shims are available, allowing up to 128 different combinations with the\r\n elastomers to fine-tune pedal stiffness. \r\nWhen it comes to the hydraulic cushioning system, we've moved away from our previous misguided use of air springs (which weren't ideal) and are now using a completely redesigned hydraulic rod. \r\nYou can elaborate on what it's like to use this hydraulic cushioning system. The throttle uses a one-way hydraulic lever, and the clutch and brakes use a two-way hydraulic lever. The bi-directional lever has the same hydraulic cushioning feeling back and forth,\r\n while the uni-directional lever has a hydraulic cushioning when pressed, but the rebound is smooth. This design is to prevent the hydraulic lever from affecting the throttle rebound speed. Limit sleeve we also upgraded, we use a softer material, hard pedal\r\n to the end will not have a strong sense of frustration. The new control box is made of metal with a closed design, which enhances the anti-jamming ability and adds a Rumble Motor hole to support Simsonn's original Rumble Motor. Plus X pedals come with the\r\n official SIMSONN Manager software, so there's no need to manually upgrade the hardware. SIMSONN Manager supports the latest Rumble Motor adjustments and currently supports 8 types of telemetry for vibration feedback and corresponding data adjustments. \r\nWe have also upgraded the limit sleeve, using a softer material so that there is no strong jolt or noise when pressing down hard. The new control box is made of metal with a closed design, enhancing its EMI interference resistance, and adding a Rumble Motor\r\n hole to support Simsonn's original haptics. SIMSONN Manager supports haptics calibration, currently offering 8 vibration feedback telemetry modes and corresponding data adjustments. However, the number of supported games is limited. If needed, we can provide\r\n you with the supported game list. For unsupported games, you can use Simhub. Regarding the difference in haptics, the Vam Pro uses a linear motor, while the Vam uses a rumble motor, and their operating principles are different. You can find more information\r\n online about their specific differences. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Med vänlig hälsning \r\n \r\n Alex Reinholdsson \r\n \r\n \r\n +46(0)738 - 24 33 88 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 1 sep. 2025 kl. 09:52 skrev \r\nnlbrokerage@ups.com: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n ﻿ \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Geachte heer/ mevrouw, \r\n UPS heeft een zending voor u ontvangen van : \r\n \r\n CAN HUANG \r\n \r\n HUNANCHANGSHAYUE LU QUBUILDING C4, \r\n \r\n \r\n LUGU ENTERPRISE PLAZA, YUELU DISTRI \r\n \r\n \r\n CT, CHANGSHA, HUNAN, CHINALU GU JIE \r\n \r\n \r\n SHENZHEN, 518128 \r\n \r\n \r\n CN \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n De Nederlandse Douane heeft de zending niet vrij gegeven en wil graag de factuur en het betalingsbewijs ontvangen in verband met twijfels over de opgegeven waarde van de goederen. \r\n Zij vragen van u: \r\n \r\n \r\nDe orginele inkoopfactuur \r\nBewijs van betaling \r\n Bij het ontbreken van beide ontvangen we graag een verklaring betreffende deze zending \r\n Indien u geen reactie geeft gaat de douane zelf een waardebepaling doen wat negatief voor u kan uitvallen. \r\n Genoemde bescheiden zo spoedig mailen of sturen naar onderstaand adres. \r\n \r\n O.V.v.
