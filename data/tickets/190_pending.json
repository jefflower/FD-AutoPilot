  "description_text": "Hi, I recently purchased a new set of Pro Plus pedals and everything is good apart from the brake pedal. I have to adjust the deadzone to 14% to stop it registering any movement after calibration. After watching Youtube videos of how to adjust the loadcell with an allen key theese new pedals have a white plastic covering and are different. Can you provide me a pdf manual or advice on how to adjust the loadcell.\r\n\r\nThanks, Ryan.\r\n\r\n",
