It continuously states \"searching for devices\" regardless of what game is being played. I've tried running the SIMSONN manager along with the simhub and with it closed. It doesnt connect in either scenario. I have reset the SIMSONN hub, I've added a grounding wire from the hub to the pedal base, nothing working. Assetto Corsa seems to recognize the modules as they work properly but reflect \"Searchig for devices\"???? Rfactor 2 & LMU do not work correctly. The modules vibrate at odd times and off just crash as they vibrate consistently without a reason. \r\nAMS 2 seems to work intermittently. Not sure what's going on. I need help as all I've gotten is frustration. Please advise how to resolve.\r\nThanks\r\nRichard Burns\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Rick Burns,   Could you please provide your order number, and also take a photo of the Simsonn Manager software interface along with the pedal’s motor installation? I’ll check the issue for you.      If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

Also, a small spark when connecting power is normal. It happens when the controller’s motor capacitors charge up. Since it’s 24V, there is no safety risk and it will not damage the control board. Please rest assured.",
