If the connection issue persists even when using a rear USB 3.0 port, press and hold the upgrade button on the control box while reconnecting the USB cable to enter upgrade mode.  Then go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-pedals, and select the .sfu firmware file that matches your pedal model to update.",
