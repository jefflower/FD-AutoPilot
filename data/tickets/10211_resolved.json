  "description_text": "Hello\r\nI'm Angelo, I'm writing from Italy. I'm interested on the new HS PRO\r\nShifter, but I would to know something else about the switching from H mode\r\nto Seq mode, that's not explained on the web page of the product.\r\nWhat does switching between H mode and sequential mode require? Tools as\r\nscrewdrivers or other tools are required? It's mandatory to substitute the\r\nH pattern top plate with the sequential top plate? There is an electronic\r\nswitch to select, in order to have different comunication channels between\r\nthe shifter and the game for the H mode and the Seq mode?\r\nIs there a user guide available for that shifter in order to better\r\nunderstand how it works?\r\nI currently have also a Plus X pedals on my rig, it will be possible to\r\nmanage both pedals and shifter using the same managing software?\r\nMany thanks in advance\r\nKind Regards\r\nAngelo G.\r\n\r\n",
