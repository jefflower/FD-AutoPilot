  "description_text": "Hello simsonn support. Yesterday I was adjusting my pedals because they\r\nwere a bit too vertical. What I did is turn around the plate (see attached\r\npicture) and nothing else. I did this to my throttle and brake also, and\r\nnothing happened. However, when I finally placed down my clutch and pressed\r\nit, a part fell out. I'm not sure if the pedal still works, I don't really\r\nwant to try because I'm afraid it will cause more damage. I would like to\r\nask what I can do about it, I'm looking for either a replacement or a\r\ntutorial on how to fix. The throttle and brake works fine, so if possible\r\nI'd only like to get my clutch pedal replaced. I have the SIMSONN plus X\r\npedal set. See part that fell off beneath.\r\n\r\nRegards, ksawery Zygmunt.\r\n\r\n",
