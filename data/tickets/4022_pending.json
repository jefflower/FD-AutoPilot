Then follow the steps below:    Open the software and go to Settings → Update, then click Check for Updates.    Check if the ProX firmware can be updated to version 2.0.3.    If no automatic update is available, please use Manual Update: Path: Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu.    After the update, please test again.    If the issue persists, try reconnecting the USB and power cable, then test again.    If it still doesn’t work, please send me a screenshot of the software interface so I can check further for you.",
