  "description_text": "This Plate is bending, i think you can also see that on the picture. Then\r\nat my normal brake pressure, because the metal plate is bend, the loadcell\r\ntouches the piece i´ve highlighted in the second picture. also i have a lot\r\nof friction on the brake sometimes and it feels very uneven when im\r\npressing/releasing the brake. im very sure that its the little plastic\r\npiece which the metal rot goes into or even the metal rod itself which\r\nmight cause some problems. maybe you can atleast also send me a new plastic\r\npart since this shouldnt be a very expensive part anyway. order number, my\r\nadress, etc.i already send you in my last mails.\r\n\r\n",
