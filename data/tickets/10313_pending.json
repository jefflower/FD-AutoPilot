  "description_text": "Hi. I'm a new customer with you, waiting on my first order to arrive. I\r\nhave more needs.....\r\n\r\nHow can I use your racing wheels on a VRS SFP20 wheel base. I currently use\r\nan adapter from Sim Race Coach and it has a USB cord. I would love to go\r\ncordless if I found a way. I would be interested in the Simsonn Hub S1\r\nWheel if I could find a way.\r\n\r\nAlso, I ordered a Pro-x Handbrake, and hope to also buy a Pro-x\r\nsequential shifter. When will you have those available?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nBob Coan\r\nThe VIllages, Florida. USA\r\n\r\n",
