  "description_text": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI've recently bought a set of Your products (pedals, hamdbrake, shifter,\r\nhaptic motors) - order No.#SSN2305. I' ll be honest - I didnt use shiter\r\nmuch during this shirt period of time, but today wanted to drive some rally\r\nsimulators and suddenly my shifter lost resistance - I opened shifter with\r\na hope that I could find some simple solution, however it turned out that a\r\nspring is broken.\r\n\r\nI attached some photos of shifter and s/n on the box.\r\n\r\nIs there any recommendations how it would be possible to fix this issue?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nArnis\r\n+371 26121016\r\n\r\n",
