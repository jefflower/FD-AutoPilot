I am using my Accufroce extreme base. This does\r\nnot happen with any of my other wheels.\r\n\r\nOnce I can resolve this issue I can do a review on your product.\r\n\r\nPlease advise with a fix.\r\n\r\nR/Mike\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at 6:47 PM SIMSONN <no-reply@loox.io> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hello M, We would be grateful if you shared how things look and feel.

You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals.
