  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Affiliate Team,\r\n\r\nI hope you’re doing well.\r\n\r\nI’m reaching out once again regarding my pending affiliate payment.\r\nAccording to my records, there is still a remaining balance of $75.80 that\r\nhas not yet been issued, and the payment is now past the expected\r\nprocessing time.\r\n\r\nI understand that delays can happen, and I truly appreciate the work your\r\nteam manages on a daily basis. However, I would be grateful if you could\r\nhelp check on this matter and process the remaining payment at your\r\nearliest convenience.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your attention and support. I look forward to your\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDavid Long\r\n\r\n",
