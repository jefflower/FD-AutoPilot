The problem still remains, i.e., full depression of the brake pedal produces only a small signal and once recalibrated the signal is very erratic. This makes it unusable because the brake pressure does not correlate to the strength of the signal received and it's impossible to achieve 100% braking. I've attached a video showing what happens. Please advise on next steps.

Please click Offset in the software to reset the pedal signal to zero; the white signal will then start from 0%. After recalibrating the pedal, the blue signal will correctly range from 0% to 100%.
