  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI received my order of Simsonn Plus X pedals today, 3 pedal plus plate\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the brake pedal it's extremely difficult to apply pressure to\r\nthe load cell, it will only register 15kg of pressure at maximum push even\r\nwith the softest possible settings.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when I apply the clutch pedal, the brake registers half the\r\nload it used to and therefore doesn't apply the brake properly in game.\r\n\r\nI have calibrated through the software and the issue persists. Can you help?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJoe Thompson\r\n\r\n",

Follow the on-screen steps in the pop-up window to reset the white signal to 0%. After that, please recalibrate the pedals.  If you would like stronger pedal resistance, you can switch to the stiffer blue or yellow elastomers.",

While holding the button, unplug the USB cable from the PC and then plug it back in. The software should detect the device entering “SIMSONN Flasher update mode”.  In the software go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update.  In the file selector choose: pedals‑firmware → pedals‑plusx.sfu.  Click “Start Update” and wait until the firmware is completely written. During this process do not disconnect the USB or close the application.  Once the update is finished (you’ll get a success prompt or the unit will reboot), unplug and re‑plug the USB then test the pedal device to confirm everything works correctly.",
