If it is confirmed that the motor was damaged due to excessive vibration intensity, we will send you a free replacement. Kindly provide your order number and shipping address so we can arrange the replacement promptly. Note: Version 2.0.9 will automatically limit the maximum vibration strength of VAM motors to 30% or 50%, to prevent damage caused by overly aggressive settings.",

If the power connection still doesn't show up after multiple attempts, then the control box may be faulty.",
