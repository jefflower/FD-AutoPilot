There was an angle deviation on a mid sheet-metal part for the HS Pro, so we asked the supplier to remake the parts, which caused the delay and a backlog of orders. We have now received the updated parts, production has resumed, and shipments have started going out. Thank you very much for your patience and understanding! ",
