  "description_text": "Good morning, about 2 months ago I purchased the Simsonn VAM Pro motors to pair with my Simsonn RPO X pedal set. I installed everything as described, but after a few minutes of operation, the motors remain active, meaning they vibrate continuously even without pressing the pedal. Can you help me solve this problem? Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
