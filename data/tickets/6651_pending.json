Does it allow the pedals to be positioned so\r\nthat the Linear Motor strikes the pedal/foot directly left–right instead of\r\nstriking up–down?\r\n\r\nIf the U-shaped mounting bracket is not intended for this purpose, what is\r\nthe recommended solution to mount the linear motors so that they can strike\r\nthe pedal/foot from the side (left–right)?\r\n\r\n",
