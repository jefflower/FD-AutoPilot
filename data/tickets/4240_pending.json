  "description_text": "Yesterday while doing an endurance race with the pedals the device kept\r\ndisconnecting.  After disconnecting 3 times within 20 minutes I decided to\r\nplug the cable into another usb port on my pc.  It stopped disconnecting\r\nfor the duration of that race.  But the RGB leds on the brake and throttle\r\npedal kept changing colors/flashing randomly.  I have the RGB set to stay a\r\nsolid color.  Today I went to use the pedals again and they kept\r\ndisconnecting every couple of seconds.  After swapping out the usb cable it\r\nstopped disconnecting.  However the RGB leds still keep changing colors\r\nrandomly.\r\n\r\nI've included a picture of the brake pedal leds.  It's hard to see in the\r\npicture but some of the leds are purple, some are blue, and a couple are\r\norange...\r\n\r\nThere is no visible damage to the usb cables.  I've also included pictures\r\nof that as well.\r\n\r\n",

Meanwhile, please check if the LED on your throttle pedal is working properly.  Please uninstall the old version of the software from your PC and install the provided version 2.1.1 (download link attached). In the software, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update, and select the file pedals-firmware-pedals-prox.sfu. After the update is completed, please test the pedals again.  In addition, regarding the disconnection issue, please avoid using USB hubs and connect the device directly to the rear USB 3.0 (blue) port of your PC to ensure stable power and data transmission.",
