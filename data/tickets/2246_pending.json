At the\r\nmoment,\r\n\r\nI don’t even feel confident entering an online championship race, as I’m\r\nafraid the issue could happen during a session.\r\n\r\nAre there any driver or firmware updates available that might fix this?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nEl mar, 14 ene 2025 a las 10:30, Eduardo Odriozola (<esles69@gmail.com>)\r\nescribió:\r\n\r\n> Hi.\r\n> I’m still having the same issues.\r\n> I can’t calibrate the pedals, and they keep disconnecting and reconnecting\r\n> during gameplay.\r\n> How can I restore the firmware of the box?\r\n> Regards, Eduardo.\r\n>\r\n> El dom, 12 ene 2025 a las 2:00, Eduardo Odriozola (<esles69@gmail.com>)\r\n> escribió:\r\n>\r\n>>  Hi,\r\n>> I can't calibrate the pedals, and the repuging issue keeps popping up all\r\n>> the time.

      "body_text": "Hi Eduardo Odriozola,  Is your wheelbase a Fanatec? This is definitely not an issue with the pedals or the control box — it’s caused by interference. Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve it.      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.",
