  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn support team,\r\n\r\nYou have sent me the wrong pedal set. I ordered the Simsonn Plus X with\r\nhaptic reactor and baseplate, but have received what I believe are the pro\r\npedals?\r\nI have attached pictures of what I received to this email.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, these are not the Plus X pedals as advertised on your\r\nwebsite. The black control box is different and has a green grounding wire\r\nand no ports for the haptic reactors. Also, the pedals look different (no\r\nholes for adjusting pedal plate).\r\n\r\nI would very much like to receive the correct Plus X pedals :) .\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKostiantyn\r\n\r\n[image: control.jpg]\r\n[image: brake.jpg]\r\n[image: box.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 24 Jul 2025 at 11:28, SIMSONN <service@simsonn.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> SIMSONN\r\n> <https://www.simsonn.com/_t/c/v3/AABTmcJlWauPzA1tbra3ZTwqZaO8WloX5D2lPbFXj7MuNpTRdECPnq05miwB8EROyxsOMnVwGq0ZXRjFOTkEuT5sn-PsvcXQjNYIzp9pUDgKID-0vpWURcPcJt87zQ2sEPB6eKgqW96m8VqdoTegQ1MKAP9tDfzBlu4_KekrkLbuSLQVjeljfMdjcFwYDR7amdSLrBZOd47Q4kmNlWhvoRbQ8bywSLSyrwbFb4G-ZQ1pF-PiEsKZLo3WZyFL-Af4gMCPOvMl3vr71EXYuQIWeAJE2QpW5L1SPXsdPwmkcBpX-1vu8fSmSp7t4zuc3BBO-F697NHxLUZSxpS1mo6N>\r\n> Order #SSN2090\r\n> One item in your order is on the way\r\n>\r\n> One item in your order is on the way.

The correct installation method is to position the cylinder body at the top with the rod pointing downward. This ensures that any excess air can be effectively expelled after multiple movements.
