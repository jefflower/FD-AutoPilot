  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you as I have recently had a consistent issue with my\r\nSimsonn Plus X pedals. The pedals will randomly disconnect while being\r\nused. I have tried plugging into every different USB port available on my\r\nPc but the issue persists. Furthermore none of my other equipment is having\r\nthis issue no matter the USB port in use. I have even tried using an\r\nexternal powered USB dock and experienced the same issue. I am hoping you\r\ncan help resolve this issue, as I am losing confidence in the product since\r\nI never know when it could disconnect. I am hoping this is as simple as\r\nneeding a new USB cable, but I look forward to your feedback. Please let me\r\nknow if anything else is needed from my end.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nIan Senkbeil\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Ian Senkbeil,   If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
