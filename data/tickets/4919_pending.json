  "description_text": "Hey There simsonn support, im writing to you guys in the regard of my\r\nracing pedals, i bought a pair of plus X pedals and they have been\r\nfantastic until now.\r\nI was racing on my sim and suddenly i lost the control of the accelerator,\r\nafter looking at the cord i found it fringed out of the connector and left\r\nthe ethernet style connector inside the pedal relay.\r\nI couldnt find an individual gas pedal so i was wondering if i need to\r\npurchase a clutch and turn it into an accelerator or what.\r\nIf you guys could get back to me soon that would be great!!\r\nHave a good rest of your guys week.\r\n-Owen Johnson\r\n\r\n",

If that doesn’t resolve the issue, we can send you a new sensor free of charge. Please provide your order number, contact name, phone number, and address, and we’ll arrange the shipment as soon as possible. ",
