  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Service Team,\r\nI am extremely disappointed with the handling of my order. Despite multiple follow-ups and assurances, the issue remains unresolved.\r\nYou have sent the light bar, but the foot plate, clearly circled in the original photo I provided, is still missing. This is unacceptable and has caused significant inconvenience, especially as this item was intended as a gift.\r\nPlease take the following actions immediately:\r\n\r\n  *   Confirm that the foot plate will be shipped without further delay.\r\n  *   Provide a firm delivery date and tracking details for this missing component.\r\n  *   Ensure this matter is escalated to the appropriate team for urgent resolution.\r\n\r\nI expect a prompt response and resolution. Failure to address this will leave me no choice but to consider further action.\r\nThank you for your immediate attention.\r\nShaun Singleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: service@simsonn.com <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSent: Wednesday, December 31, 2025 7:12 PM\r\nTo: thesingleton4@hotmail.com <thesingleton4@hotmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Re: Missing Components in Order\r\n\r\nHi shaun singleton,\r\n\r\nI apologize for not getting back to you sooner.
