  "description_text": "Hello, I was about to buy one of your pedal sets, and I wanted to ask you what the differences were between the Plus X and the Pro X Ultra. Are the elastometers the same? How does the feeling of the brake change? How do you justify the higher price? So ultimately what are the differences between the two? Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

ProX Ultra includes lighting effects and supports lighting telemetry.    ProX Ultra also features 8-stage damping fine adjustment.    Other aspects are largely the same.",
