  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI purchased my Simsonn pedals on 9/24/2025.\r\nOver the last ~2 weeks, a bolt at the bottom of the throttle pedal has been\r\nrepeatedly backing out during normal use.\r\nThis has not occurred previously and now requires frequent re-tightening.\r\nI wanted to ask whether this is a known issue, if updated hardware exists,\r\nor if there is a recommended permanent solution.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",
