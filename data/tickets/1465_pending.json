      "body_text": "Hi Sam Forrest,  In the “Settings - Update” section, click “Manual Firmware Update,” then navigate to the pedals-firmware folder → pedals folder → and select the proxultra.sfu file to update. This firmware will disable the 4th axis.      Additionally, seeing a spark when plugging the 24V power supply into the control board is normal—it's caused by the capacitors charging. It won't affect performance or cause any damage, so please don’t worry. ",
