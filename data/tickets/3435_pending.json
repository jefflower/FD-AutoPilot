Is it possible that it's not working? I've had the \r\npedals for a while now, connected to Simsonn config V4, and the manual \r\nsays Sim Racing Pro Pedal. Now I've installed the new version (Manager \r\n2.1.0), and after the update, it works perfectly. It now says Simsonn \r\nPlus. It's all confusing. I actually want the VAM system, but I don't \r\nknow which one to use. Greeting Oliver Jakobi\r\n\r\n",

You only need to purchase VAM Pro + 24V DC power supply + PlusX control box.      https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-vam-pedals-haptic-reactor?variant=51351053533498",
