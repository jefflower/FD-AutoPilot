  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased the *VAM Pro Linear Motor* and would like to use it\r\nwith my *Simsonn Pro Pedals*, which I previously bought through *Amazon*.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since the purchase was made via Amazon, I do not have a\r\ndirect Simsonn order number. However, the Amazon product code (ASIN) is:\r\n*B0D7MMSK14*\r\nThe pedals were ordered around: 02.12.2024\r\n\r\nCould you please help me confirm whether I need a *Plus X Control Box* or\r\nany additional components to use the VAM Pro with my current pedals?\r\n\r\nI want to make sure everything is compatible before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your support!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nWitold Yasempa\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Witek Zasempa,  That should be no problem. Once you receive the control box, please perform an Offset factory calibration for the pedals. Since the control box was purchased separately, it doesn’t come with pre-configured calibration values, so a manual calibration is required. Please use the latest version of SIMSONN Manager 2.0.9 for this process. It also supports SIMHUB version 9.9.3.       https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
