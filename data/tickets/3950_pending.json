I have tried recalibration and setting the deadzones again, but iRacing still ignores it. I cannot get 100% throttle.\r\nCan you please help?\r\n-Vinnie\r\n",

Then, in the Simsonn Manager interface, click Offset to reset the offset and complete the pedal calibration. After calibration, please note that iRacing has special requirements — you will also need to recalibrate the pedals within the game settings.      Please note: iRacing requires an additional in-game calibration — all axes must be calibrated to an output value of 4095. ",

      "body_text": " Thanks for responding,\r\nI was still having the issue, but I seem to have resolved it by adding even more deadzone. The only issue I have now is with signal noise. When holding the Throttle or Clutch, I get a bit of noise which bounces around the input by a couple of %. It's not too bad on the Brake. I have grounded the control box to the sim rig and added ferrite chokes to all the cables, but I still have noise. Not sure if there is anything else that can be done.\r\nThanks!\r\n-Vinnie\r\n    ",
