  "description_text": "hi, I bought the  simsonn pro x pedals 6 months ago, but my feet are a bit\r\nlow and I would need a heel plate, my question is whether the heel plate\r\nthat you sell on your site includes screws and everything needed to be\r\ninstalled, or does it just come with the plate itself. Note: I'm referring\r\nto the carbon fiber heel plate, the one that is only placed in front of the\r\npedals, the one you have for sale for 28 dollars, not the base plate\r\n\r\n",
