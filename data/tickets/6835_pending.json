Now\r\nthat I received an email that I could have just clicked the link to add the\r\npower supply, which I did, I would like to cancel my order on the power\r\nsupply which is order number\r\nSSN3916.\r\nCan you please cancel the order and issue me a refund? Thank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Matthew Yang\r\n\r\n",
