  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn team!\r\n\r\nI was never trying to request replacements, the hustle of shipping to Colombia is in the worst right now, I don't want you to be in that boat. I could overcome the issues by 3D printing a static isolation from the wheelbase and the stripped screw is not noticeable when the steering wheel is in use, in other words, I've been loving my Sim experience. The issue that made me answer to this email is that the PC stopped recognizing the button plate, According to Device Manager the USB device has two separate issues, is either saying \"Unknown USB Device(Set Address Failed)\", or, \"Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)\". I did some troubleshooting, and research.\r\nThe steps followed are:\r\n\r\n- Unplug and plug back in the USB cable from both ends.\r\n- Unplug and plug the cable into other known working USB ports, both 2.0 and 3.0, and on both front panel and directly to the Mother board I/O panel.\r\n- Connected the cable directly to the PC, no USB extensions.\r\n- Confirm Windows is up to date.\r\n- Looked for drivers and driver updates.\r\n- Disabling the USB Selective suspend\r\n- Disabling Fast Startup\r\n- Used known working devices into the different tested known working USB ports.\r\n- Used Terminal to run sfc /scannow\r\n- Reinstalled the latest Chipset Driver\r\n- Verified the USB Root Hub’s Power Management in Device Manager has “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power” unchecked\r\nAnd\r\n- The BIOS is up to date\r\n\r\nThe PC behavior was nothing out of the norm. Last night I raced for about 2 hours, no issues, but today, I couldn't do anything with the steering wheel, it just happened. I did no driver updates, no nothing.\r\n\r\nI'm reaching out to ask for your assistance to this matter, Maybe a device driver that I can manually install, or more troubleshooting steps.\r\n\r\nI hope you have a happy new year and thanks in advance for the assistance,\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\nIván Bernal\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: service@simsonn.com <service@simsonn.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, October 9, 2025 8:22 PM\r\nTo: ivanbernal16@hotmail.com <ivanbernal16@hotmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Newly purchased product issues\r\n\r\nHi Ivan Bernal,\r\n\r\nYou can record a short video showing the issue and send it to me via Google Drive, making sure to grant access permission.\r\nIf the issue is confirmed, we will send you a new replacement free of charge.\r\nAll our products are fully tested before shipment, so it’s possible that vibration or impact during international transit caused the fault or looseness.\r\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\r\nAlso, please provide your order number, contact name, phone number, and address so we can arrange the follow-up accordingly.\r\n\r\nOn Thu, 9 Oct at 6:01 PM , Ivan Bernal <ivanbernal16@hotmail.com> wrote:\r\nHi Simsonn Team!\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you well.\r\n\r\nToday I'm reaching out to give you visibility on three issues that my new Carbon Fiber S1 came with.\r\n\r\nThe first one was the switch close to the \"PIT\" button, it is loose and sometimes it clicks by itself. And the last one is that I felt the carbon fiber from the back was a bit open, upon inspection, I noticed one screw was not tighten, for my surprise, the thread inside the Hub is stripped, and last but not least, the rotary encoders for \"MAP\" and \"ADJ\" do not recognize when pushed.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I wanted to tell you that the provided screws came without nuts and they are just too short for me to install the really cool Simsonn plate, I needed to source 6x M5 50mm screws to at least mount the wheel to the quick release without the plate.\r\n\r\nThanks for the attention, I hope this gives you a bit of an idea of what customers are getting when ordering your devices. I will go for the 3 pedal set in the future, I hope that all comes with the great quality that made Simsonn a trusty name in the simulation world.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nIván Bernal\r\n4681:4206036\r\n\r\n",

I also went ahead and tested the unit in another PC, this time with a windows 10 OS this PC was my testing system before building my now sim racing PC and it was working in the past, right now, the same error pops up when connecting the unit, again using different USB ports 2.0 and 3.0. These last steps lead me to believe is not a driver's issue, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nI will keep an eye on future recommendations from your side to get the steering wheel working again!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nIvan Bernal.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",
