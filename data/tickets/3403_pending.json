If you encounter any USB errors, please take a screenshot and send it to us for review. We recommend connecting the device to the rear USB 3.0 (blue) port of your computer, or using a powered USB device, as the issue is likely caused by insufficient power supply. You may also try updating the firmware again to ensure proper functionality.      Please go to Settings → Update → Check for Updates to perform the update. Once the update is complete, please unplug and reconnect the USB.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
