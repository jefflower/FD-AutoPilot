  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nI am contacting you to request a return of my Steering Wheel Hub, as one of\r\nthe paddle shifters has a manufacturing defect.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, one of the paddles does not have a single linear travel.\r\nInstead, it has two distinct stages of movement, as if there is mechanical\r\nplay or looseness. This causes two internal parts not to move together,\r\nresulting in an inconsistent and incorrect feel compared to the other\r\npaddle.\r\n\r\nI have attached a video where the defect can be clearly seen and heard.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a manufacturing issue present under normal use, I would\r\nlike to request a return and refund (or replacement, if applicable). Please\r\nlet me know the next steps to proceed with the return process.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n\r\n Simsonn Wheel hub\r\n<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gF3bo8tMXcWWIc5bdwrIvPPi0fh4twx4>\r\n\r\n",
