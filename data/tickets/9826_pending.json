My mount has the same holes used by some Logitech and Thrustmaster pedals.\r\nI use the Thrustmaster T-LCM, applied directly with 4 screws. The spacing between the holes is: Horizontal = 235 mm : Vertical = 220 mm.\r\n\r\nMy question is whether your base includes these holes, or if not, if you can provide it with these additional holes.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMario Pires\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nDe: service@simsonn.com ",
