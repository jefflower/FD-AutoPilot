  "description_text": "Hey good morning,\r\n It looks like hub box needs to be replaced because it seems the brake port has shorted out. It is sparking when I plug it in the plug a few times. I also tried plugging the brake plug into the throttle port and it came on. So I believe it’s the hub box that will need to be replaced. \r\n\r\nIt also might be the reason the haptics don’t work either because every time I plug it in, it makes the pedals malfunction and turn off and on repeatedly. \r\n\r\nAgain thanks for your help. \r\n",

Also, please open the hub box, remove the PCB, and send us clear high-resolution photos of both sides of the board. I will review them to check for any possible short circuits, poor solder joints, or connector issues. ",
