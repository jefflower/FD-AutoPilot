  "description_text": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nCould you please tell me if the Pro X Ultra Control Box would offer any technical advantages due to its superior chip? And if so, what are they? I assume that if I switch to compatible RJ connectors, this box can also be used with other pedals. Thanks in advance. Best regards from Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Karl Heinz,  Compared to the PlusX, the Pro X Ultra features 16-bit resolution sampling and supports simultaneous acquisition on three channels instead of polling. The PlusX uses 12-bit resolution with three-channel polling. The Pro X Ultra also supports RGB lighting and uses differential signaling for stronger anti-interference performance. However, it is only compatible with Pro X Ultra pedals and cannot be used with PlusX pedals. ",
