They were the older model with the older control box.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey use the original control box and only calibrate with the original\r\nsoftware and freejoy\r\n\r\nIs there a way to upgrade this or do I need a new control box to use the\r\nnew software\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso if I bought a new control box so I could use your haptics. Would it be\r\ncompatible\r\n\r\n",

I can't believe how much you have grown since I\r\nbought your pedals back in March of 2024.
