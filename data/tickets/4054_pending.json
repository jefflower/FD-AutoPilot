      "body_text": "Hi Pandu Wirawan,    Please press the Upgrade button on the control box and reconnect the USB. The software should then indicate that it has entered Firmware Upgrade Mode. If it still shows “Not Connected,” the issue may be due to insufficient USB power. In this case, please connect the USB cable to a USB 3.0 port (blue) on the back of your PC, and avoid using USB hubs.  Once the above steps are completed, navigate to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Select the file pedals-firmware-pedals-prox.sfu After the update is finished, check again to confirm whether the device connects properly.",
