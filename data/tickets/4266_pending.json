  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Support,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a set of *Simsonn Plus X pedals* and I am experiencing\r\nissues with calibration using *Simsonn Manager 2.1*.\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   CPU1 firmware: v2.0.2\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   CPU2 firmware: v2.0.0\r\n\r\nThe problem I’m facing:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   After completing calibration, when I set values such as *elastomers,\r\n   maximum force, or deadzones*, they reset every time I click *Save*.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The values are not written to the pedals, so in iRacing the game still\r\n   expects the original calibration (around 45 kg brake force), even if I set\r\n   maximum force to 20 kg.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Deadzones are also not being applied.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following without success:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Running Simsonn Manager as Administrator\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Using different USB ports (directly on the motherboard)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Reinstalling Simsonn Manager\r\n\r\nCould you please advise me on how to resolve this issue? Should both CPUs\r\nbe updated to the same firmware version, or is there another step I am\r\nmissing to ensure that calibration values are saved correctly?\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance,\r\nCosmin\r\n\r\n",

I tried using SimPedalsConfig V3.5, V4, and FreeJoy, but in all cases the pedals are not recognized by the software at all.",

Also, please note that iRacing requires an additional re-calibration, as it does not automatically apply the preset values of the pedals, which is a particular characteristic of this game.      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdSWa1bxmbPksj9Hlzuo8bl7_bM8ixr/view?usp=drivesdk",
