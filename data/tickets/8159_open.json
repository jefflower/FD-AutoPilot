I played one game with this new shifter and it went more than it should into second gear, it got stuck and disconnected from the PC. Button lights keep working, but does not recognise by the PC no more. I removed bottom screws to check inside and I found that the pole went more than it should have and broke the electronics board. I believe the problem is that the stick is too short and it was barely held by the H pattern, it wasn’t long enough to hold the stick in place. I did not use force, you can see from the scratches of H pattern that stick is very short. You can see from the video I have attached to this email below or the image.\r\n\r\nCan you please send me a replacement together with the new control box for the pedals?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/06d00nnxlfPkEKGJkH6v_ZxQw#shifter￼\r\nMy order number is SSN3385\r\nContact name: Visvaldas Stonkus\r\nShipping address: Butvydo g. 28, 14259, Vilnius, Lithuania\r\nPhone number: +37063676280\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nVisvaldas\r\n\r\n> ",
