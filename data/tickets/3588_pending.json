Is it possible to get just this part shipped to me?\r\nIf so i could install it myself when it arrives. Thanks!\r\nMarvin Ahrens\r\n\r\n",

The bushing (axle sleeve) and adjustable panel design you mentioned are actually only present in the PlusX pedal series. The Pro Plus model does not include these upgraded mechanical structures.     To ensure we provide the correct technical support and compatible accessories, please help us confirm your exact model. If possible, kindly share your order number or additional photos (including the control box, baseplate, etc.), and we’ll assist you promptly.",
