This spacer is mainly intended for short-travel F1 setups, but for rally use it is recommended to remove it. Additionally, in the coming days we will be releasing a white damper (hardness 30HA), which is softer compared to the current red damper (60HA). If you feel it is still too stiff for children, the white damper would be a suitable option. ",
