If you want it to turn off completely, you need to unplug/switch off the separate 24V power adapter from the wall outlet. Turning off the PC alone will not fully cut the power. ",

Energy is a fortune in the uk surely it carnt be that had to put a least a switch on the box to turn of power for that input kind regards gary its a shame as the pedles are excellent apart from that one design floor kind regards gary\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n>   \r\n> ",

Since the pedal control box is designed to be very compact, we previously prioritized functionality and stability, so we didn’t include power-saving/standby control in the design. Thank you very much for your feedback — we will evaluate this and improve it in future revisions. ",
