  "description_text": "Hello dear simsonn team, I bought the simsonn pro plus via Amazon months ago. The white stuff on the pedals from the loadcell looked like it driped, but it is solid so i didnt took more thoughts about it. My problem is now i have to recalibrate the pedals every 2 -3 days. It's like the start point is changing. Additionally u have to set a decent dead zone because it's always sending signals. Yes I used the ground cable and yes this happens no matter if the wheelbase is active or not. Best regards Dennis -- Gesendet mit der WEB.DE Mail App \r\n\r\n",

The holding brackets of the load cell at the brake pedal looks a bit short (maybe it's just in my mind but if I apply full force on the brake pedals it feels like its bending) Because i bought them via Amazon, should I submit a ticket there or can I send them back to you directly or could you exchange the brakes?
