I tried to restart and update the software but the problem is still there. What should I do and how do I fix it?\n\nHope to hear from you soon\nWan",

You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue. https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
