  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nA few days ago I bought the Plus X 3 pedal set with the base plate on\r\nAmazon Canada. They went on sale so I purchased them. This morning, it said\r\nthat you cancelled my order and now the sale has ended, plus you have\r\nraised the prices higher than before the sale...\r\nI am a content creator on Tiktok and Instagram, currently making Youtube\r\nvideos to be posted soon.\r\nMy name is Pitlane Protocol. I was going to make a review about the pedals\r\nbut now I won't be able to. I might need to make a video about this\r\nsituation... I also contacted you guys 2 times on Instagram before buying\r\nthem to make a collaboration and no answer. I am not impressed with all of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nPlease advise\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n",
