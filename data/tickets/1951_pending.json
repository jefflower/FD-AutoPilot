  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have the Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedals I bought a couple of months ago and\r\nI'm having a few issues.\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly I'm having an issue where the pedals in the\r\nmanager are calibrated, however in any game the pedal input does not\r\nregister anything until it reaches 50% travel. I have tried to delete and\r\nredownload the software and I've updated both the manager and control box\r\nas well and it still is giving me an issue and I am unable to use them\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is I have a VAM Pro motor on the brake pedal and it does\r\nnot do anything outside of the manager test. It will not react to any ABS\r\nevent in any game I've tried.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time\r\nChris\r\n\r\n",

Once the update is complete, you can use the Offset function to reset the offset to zero, which will automatically adjust the dead zone to the minimum edge based on the current pedal pressure.  Second, make sure the software is up to date and review our telemetry support list. If the telemetry you need is not listed, you can use SIMHUB 9.9.3, which supports over 100 telemetry features.",
