      "body_text": "Hi Federico Simoncini,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
