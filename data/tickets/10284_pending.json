  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to follow up on my previous message, as I have not yet\r\nreceived a reply.\r\n\r\nOrder N’ SSN4600\r\n\r\nI recently had to pay 41.82 € in import charges requested by UPS, as the\r\norder was shipped from China. At the time of purchase, I understood that\r\nthe product would be shipped from a European warehouse, and I was not aware\r\nthat additional customs charges could apply.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I would kindly like to ask:\r\n- why the order was shipped from outside the EU, and\r\n- whether it is possible to receive a refund or compensation for the import\r\ncharges I had to pay.\r\n\r\nI paid these fees only to avoid delays with the delivery, Since it was a\r\nChristmas gift as anticipated in the old email, and I would really\r\nappreciate your clarification on this matter.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time and support.\r\nI look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nSamuele\r\n\r\n",
