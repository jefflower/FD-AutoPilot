  "description_text": "I did not receive the package. I received glasses that were addressed to me, but not the elastomers I had ordered. The glasses seem weird because I don't think your website sells sunglasses. It's like a 3rd party distributor sent me the wrong product. I never signed for anything. The tracking link says it was delivered yesterday to my front door- which is not the case. Are you able to resend the elastomers I ordered?
