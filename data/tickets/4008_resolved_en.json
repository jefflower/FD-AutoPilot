However, the motors are not detected by the Simsonn Manager. When I plugged in the motor to the controller there was a pop and a burning electrical smell. I believe the controller shorted out.\n\nAre you able to send me a replacement controller?\n\nThanks,\nBen",

It is normal to see sparks when connecting the 24V power to the PlusX control box, as the motor capacitors are charging. Since it uses a 24V safe voltage, there is no risk and it will not damage the control box. Please reconnect the USB, then connect the 24V power, and check in the SIMSONN Manager interface whether the power shows as connected. Also, click the “Vibration” button to see if the VAM Pro vibrates properly. You can also use SimHub version 9.9.3 or later to telemetry our motor.",
