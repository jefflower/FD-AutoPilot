  "description_text": "Hi my name is jordan and I placed an order back on June 7th and I got a\r\nconfirmation email and a tracking number. According to FedEx the shipment\r\nwas created then canceled by the sender but I received an email on Friday\r\nJune 13th from Simsonn saying the shipment was on its way. It is now\r\nSaturday June 21st and I have still not received the shipment and it was\r\nsupposed to arrive within 3-7 business days. I would just like some help on\r\nfinding out where the package may be or if it ever got shipped out, it\r\nwould be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n",
