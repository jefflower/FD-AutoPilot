  "description_text": "Hi there, I just received my 2nd package from order\r\nSSN3533.  Across both packages I appear to have received everything besides\r\nthe 3rd VAM Pro motor from the 3 pack.  Photo 1 was the first package with\r\nonly 2 motors, the power unit, control box, and the directional braces for\r\nthrottle and brake.  The 2nd package had the handbrake only.  I worry that\r\nthe order was mid-packaged with only 2 motors instead of all 3.  The 2nd\r\nphoto shows the handbrake only as well as the first package with everything\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nPlease help,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n",
