      "body_text": "Hi J Waygood,  If the LED still does not display correctly after you plug the brake pedal into the throttle port, it’s likely that the LED module was damaged by impact during shipping. We can send you replacement left and right LED assemblies for the brake pedal for you to replace. Please provide your order number and the recipient name, phone number, and shipping address, so we can arrange the replacement shipment as soon as possible. ",
