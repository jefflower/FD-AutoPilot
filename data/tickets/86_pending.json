  "description_text": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI recently ordered a shifter and pedal set from your company off Amazon Canada, and was wondering where they would be shipping from and if you knew whether they would be subject to any tarrifs or import fees. The listing on Amazon doesn't say there are any, but the pictures did mention shipping from within the United States so I wasn't fully sure. Any information would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n",
