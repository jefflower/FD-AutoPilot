  "subject": "Plus X Pedals Suddenly Not working properly",
  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am reaching out regarding an issue I am experiencing with my Plus X pedals. They were functioning correctly until recently when I began noticing a lag issue. Specifically, during both calibration and regular use, the throttle and brake inputs appear to freeze briefly in the software’s calibration curve box before continuing. This makes it difficult to achieve smooth and accurate pedal response.\r\n\r\nTo troubleshoot, I have already rewired the control box to avoid any EMI issue, but unfortunately, the issue persists. I would appreciate any guidance you can provide to help resolve this problem. Could you please advise on the next steps for further troubleshooting?\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nGet Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>\r\n\r\n",

However, this is the first time I’ve encountered such an issue. In theory, the pedals should not stutter unless your computer is running slowly.  In addition, you can download the VKB JoyTester tool, which allows you to monitor the pedal’s input curves in real time. If the pedals are genuinely stuttering, you’ll immediately see breaks in the curve.  If Simsonn Manager shows stuttering but VKB JoyTester does not, it is likely due to low computer specifications affecting the software performance.     https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/pages/downloads",
