      "body_text": "Hi Jack Ridenour,  To upgrade to Pro Plus, you will need to purchase the PlusX control board, a dedicated power supply, and the VAM Pro motor. Please make sure to specify the type of power plug required for your country/region when placing the order.      Additionally, you can upgrade the damping and hydraulic kits for a more realistic pedal feel.      https://www.simsonn.com/products/plus-ultra-upgrade-kit",
