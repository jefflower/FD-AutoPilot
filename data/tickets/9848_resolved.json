  "subject": "Pro X Pedals Issue",
  "description_text": "*Dear Simsonn Support Team,*\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a set of Pro X pedals second-hand, and I’ve managed to\r\nget them working properly. However, the previous owner also included three\r\nSimagic P-HPR (Haptic Pedal Reactors). These initially worked for a short\r\ntime but have since stopped functioning.\r\n\r\nHere’s what I’ve done so far:\r\n\r\n   - Updated the Control Box to the latest firmware.\r\n   - Installed and am running the latest version of Simsonn Manager.\r\n   - Verified that the 24V power supply is working and outputting the\r\n   correct voltage.\r\n\r\nAdditional observations:\r\n\r\n   - The Motor 1 port on the Control Box worked fairly consistently at\r\n   first, while ports 2 and 3 did not.\r\n   - At one point, all three ports worked briefly, but now none of them\r\n   respond.\r\n   - Swapping the P-HPR units between ports did not make any difference.\r\n\r\nI suspect the issue may be related to the Control Box. Is there a specific\r\nconnection order (e.g., power first, then USB, or vice versa) that is\r\nimportant for proper operation? Any troubleshooting steps you can provide\r\nwould be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTo assist with identification, I’ve attached:\r\n\r\n   - Photos of the retail box for the pedals.\r\n   - A photo of the Control Box.\r\n   - A screenshot of Simsonn Manager showing the firmware version of the\r\n   Control Box and the software version of Simsonn Manager.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and support. Please let me know if you need any\r\nadditional information.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nWill Bann\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Will B,  The ProX controller only supports one-direction control of voice coil motors, while the ProX Ultra supports bidirectional control. You may consider upgrading to the ProX Ultra controller, as it provides significantly stronger motor output compared to the ProX. If you are using Simagic motors, they are theoretically supported as well. At the moment, could you please confirm whether the vibration strength set to 10% is too low, and whether the issue still persists after unplugging and reconnecting the USB and power?      https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-vam-pedals-haptic-reactor?variant=51399342293306",
