Please use a toothpick to gently push it to the other side, then reconnect the USB cable. The device will enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → handbrake-firmware → handbrake-hbpro.sfu in the software, and complete the update. After the upgrade, make sure to switch the recovery button back to its original position. ",
