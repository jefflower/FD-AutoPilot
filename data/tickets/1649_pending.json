I entered in this email, but never got a order confirmation. I don't know if it was a typo or a problem on your side. But I do have the bank statements saying it went through, I ordered it July 14th and would just like to track the package! Is there any way I can do that?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMichael Leech\r\n\r\nSent from my T-Mobile 5G Device\r\nGet Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n\r\n",
