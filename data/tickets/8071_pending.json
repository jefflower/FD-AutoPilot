  "description_text": "Hello,\r\nMy name is Kevin Graziose. I ordered a set of your black plus x 3 set\r\npedals back in November 28 via Amazon through your storefront. They were\r\nshipped via fedex and were supposed to arrive December 9. Tracking hasn’t\r\nmoved since Monday December 8 and fedex has no location of the package.\r\nShould I be in contact with them or you about trying to get a replacement\r\nset? I can provide the tracking number if you need it. Would you also\r\nrecommend I just purchase the replacement via your website?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n",
