  "description_text": "Hello! I just downloaded the Simsonn Manager software, because I was planning on buying the Haptics Motors for the pedals. My Pro Pedals or Plus X pedals. I can not entirely find out, which version I have, because I have the old USB Box without the ports for the Pedal Haptic Motors., was shown \"Old Version\" 1.7.3 I think in the Simsonn Manager. I opened the older software SimPedalsConfig v4 and wanted to flash the firmware, but it isnt downloading anything. I cant flash firmware because there is no .bin file!! Now Im stuck and I dont know what to do! Can you help me and provide a direct link to the firmware file? PLEASE Please help me since I dont want to restart the PC. Im scared to ruin the pedals. They worked great for so long..... Thank you in advance! Best Regards Jacob Bodewig\r\n",

Open SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 and check if it has entered recovery mode.  If recovery mode is detected, go to Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.  After the update is complete, test the device to see if it has been restored successfully.dewig,",
