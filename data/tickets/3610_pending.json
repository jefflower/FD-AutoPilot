The problem is that when I change the color of the lights on my pedalboard, it causes the interference I sent you in the video. So I'm forced to leave the original lights in all colors, and that's not cool.

However, I didn't dare update it, something I did on the other one and perhaps shouldn't have done because everything works perfectly without it. However, to ensure everything is perfect, I have to go through SimHub because your software is very buggy. Do you advise me to still update it or not? However, thank you very much for sending me a new control box. Aside from the control box, which was defective, if I have any complaints, you should provide more tutorials regarding installations and known issues because for foreign countries, language is a barrier, even if it's just translating the manual into French, as in other languages. Thank you very much, and I hope to see you soon. ??

For example, the red curve should be close to 60kg at full brake travel, but the displayed value might not be entirely correct. However, this does not affect normal usage. When calibrating, simply apply your usual pedal force during the calibration process. In addition, Fanatec DD wheelbases can cause significant interference. For the motor issue, I will provide you with a detailed troubleshooting procedure.      In addition, could you please provide your order details as well, so that we can assist you accordingly?      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

When calibrating, simply apply your usual pedal force during the calibration process. \n \n In addition, Fanatec DD wheelbases can cause significant interference.

Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding. \n \n \n    2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive. \n \n \n    3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup. \n \n \n    4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible. \n \n \n    5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs. \n \n \n    6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference. \n \n \n    7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements. \n \n \n    8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended.

If you are still concerned about the force display, we can send you a replacement Pro X Ultra control box. \n \n In addition, for the brake’s VAM Pro, we recommend using 4 nylon screws and washers, which can effectively isolate VAM Pro interference on the brake signal. The throttle and clutch are not affected, as their sensors are made from non-metallic materials. ",

I just tested it, and it works very well. However, I didn't dare update it, something I did on the other one and perhaps shouldn't have done because everything works perfectly without it. \n However, to ensure everything is perfect, I have to go through SimHub because your software is very buggy. \n Do you advise me to still update it or not? \n However, thank you very much for sending me a new control box. \n Aside from the control box, which was defective, if I have any complaints, you should provide more tutorials regarding installations and known issues because for foreign countries, language is a barrier, even if it's just translating the manual into French, as in other languages. \n Thank you very much, and I hope to see you soon. ??  \n   \n Envoyé depuis l'application Mail Orange \n \n   \n   \n ---------------- \n \n \nDe : \"support@simsonn.com\" <support@simsonn.com> \n \n \nEnvoyé : jeudi 04 septembre 2025 08:18 \n \n \nÀ : nicolas.meney@orange.fr \n \n \nObjet : Ticket Received - RE: Re: RE: Ticket Received - RE: Re: RE: Ticket Received - RE: Ticket Received - RE: Ticket Received - RE: Re: RE: Re: Connection problem VAM PRO \n \n   \n   \n \n  \n Hi Nicolas MENEY \n \n \n We would like to acknowledge that we have received your request and a ticket has been created. \n \n A support representative will be reviewing your request and will send you a personal response.(usually within 24 hours). \n \n   \n To view the status of the ticket or add comments, please visit  \n \n \nhttps://simsonn.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/tickets/3457?follow=email \n \n   \n Thank you for your patience. \n \n \n \nView ticket \n \n \nIf the button doesn't work, copy-paste this URL in your browser's address bar: https://simsonn.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/tickets/3457?follow=email \n \n \n \n Regards, \n \n simsonn Support Team",

The video you uploaded is incomplete, so I’m unable to fully check the problem. Please upload the complete video to Google Drive and grant access permissions, so I can review how the RGB interference occurs. We will also run internal tests to better address the issue. ",
