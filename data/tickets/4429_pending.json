      "body_text": "Hi 島村優助,  It’s likely a configuration issue. Please update the firmware first, then try re-binding the pedals in another game. We’ve tested internally, and LMU is fully supported.      Please uninstall the old version on your computer, then reinstall version 2.1.2 and update the firmware. After the update, the device version should display as CPU1: 2.0.5, CPU2: 2.0.3. If the issue persists, please feel free to contact me.       https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZwHUqhhmJw0IBGDO8mGONPbrICJU3z1/view?usp=drive_link",
