  "description_text": "Good afternoon, today I received the Simsonn Pro X Ultra Pedals and when I\r\nmounted them to my rig it was working fine but after 30 minutes of playing\r\nthe throttle stopped working. The RGB lights are working fine but the pedal\r\ndoesn't register anything. I already tried to calibrate a few times,\r\nturning off and turning on my PC and I have the latest Simsonn Manager\r\nversion. Let me know what more I can do to try to make them work again.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nHugo\r\n\r\n",
