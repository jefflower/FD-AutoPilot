Here is my order\r\nnumber\r\n\r\n112-1658015-1975468\r\n\r\nI have only had the shifter since Sept 19th with daily use. The shifter no\r\nlonger returns smoothly from the reverse downshift position. Returns just\r\nfrom up shift. Everything else works as it should. Still will down shift\r\nbut will not return to neutral position\r\n\r\n",
