I am very satisfied with my equipment, and I plan to get an H and sequential gearbox soon. However, I have a problem with the cable that connects my steering wheel to the PC. I can therefore no longer use my equipment. I would like you to inform me about the cable and give me a reference so that I can order quickly. I would like to point out that this request has already been made to you via WhatsApp, and I have not received a response. So please help me. Thank you. \r\n\r\n",
