The issue I am actually having is that gear 1-2-5-6-7-Reverse are not engaging/showing up in game. The games aren't detecting any selection however gear 3-4 and the s1/s2 buttons are registering. I have provided a few images to show the steps I am going through.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nGet Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>\r\n________________________________\r\n",
