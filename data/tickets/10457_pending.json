  "description_text": "Hi I am a little confused on which controller box I need to purchase for\r\nthe 3 pack vam pro haptics. I'm purchasing from amazon and didn't see much\r\ndetail online.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FPWYHLZH/ref=sw_img_1?th=1\r\n^ this is the 3 pack I wanted to purchase.\r\n\r\nI was just unsure if I need the Plus X or Pro X controller box.\r\n\r\nAlso I am not using Simsonn pedals. This is for a later upgrade. I\r\ncurrently am using fanatec pedals and can 3d print an adapter if I need to\r\nbut have found a lot of brackets on Etsy to be able to attach these\r\nhaptics. I would like to confirm that it will still work with my pedals as\r\nthe haptics I assume would plug right into the PC?\r\n\r\nPlease advise, thank you very much!\r\n\r\n",
