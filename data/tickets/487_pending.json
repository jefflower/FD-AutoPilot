  "description_text": "Hi Team Simsonn,\r\n\r\ncould you please provide us the opertunity to see the force giving to the pedal in kg or newton?\r\n\r\nIt's annoying that as soon as you change the elastomers, you only pedal with the approximate force from before to configure it. If you could see how much KG you are pedaling, configuration would be much(!) easier.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\n",
