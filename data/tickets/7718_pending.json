  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI hope you are doing well! It has been very positive to see that there has been a number of sales made using my referral link - thanks again for reaching out to collaborate!\r\n\r\nI did notice however, that I appear to be in the v1 members tier on the commission side when I should be in the v2 members according to the size of my following. All of my commissions earned so far have therefore been lower than expected - especially now as I have gone above $4000 in sales.\r\n\r\nI would be very appreciative if my tier could be changed and the commissions adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nWishing you a great week ahead!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nDaragh Kennedy (MpowR)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
