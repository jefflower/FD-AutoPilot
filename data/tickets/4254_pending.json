You can try to update the software\r\nManual Upgrade Steps:\r\n1. Ensure SIMSONN Manager is the latest version: First, make sure SIMSONN Manager is updated to version 2.0.6 Then, press the \"Upgrade Button\" on the main control board to enter upgrade mode.\r\n2. Reconnect USB: Unplug the current USB connection and reconnect the USB cable to ensure the device is properly reconnected, and the pedals enter upgrade mode.\r\n3. Manually select the firmware for upgrade: In the update interface, click the \"Manual Update\" button. For ProX models, select the prox.sfu firmware file from the pedals directory and click \"Start Upgrade.\"\r\n4. Wait for the upgrade to complete: Please wait patiently for the upgrade to finish. During the process, the pedal’s LED will turn off, indicating that the light upgrade is in progress.\r\n5. Post-upgrade action: After the upgrade is complete, the LED will display the boot-up animation, indicating the upgrade was successful. At this point, manually release the \"Upgrade Button.\"\r\n6. Restore to normal working mode: Finally, unplug and reconnect the USB, and the device will return to normal working mode, completing the upgrade.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nsupport@simsonn.com\r\n\r\nFrom: Maxime Pambrun<mailto:maxp-44@hotmail.com>\r\nDate: 2025-04-14 20:56\r\nTo: support@simsonn.com<mailto:support@simsonn.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Break pedal LED broke\r\nHi yes it is broke on both side\r\nI have an other question .. is it normal that the signal is not stable I will send you a video\r\n\r\nHave a good Day\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvoyé de mon iPhone\r\n\r\nLe 10 avr. 2025 à 21:30, support@simsonn.com a écrit :\r\n\r\n﻿\r\nHi，\r\nIs the light bar on both ends of the brake broken?\r\n________________________________\r\nsupport@simsonn.com\r\n\r\nFrom: Maxime Pambrun<mailto:maxp-44@hotmail.com>\r\nDate: 2025-04-10 21:41\r\nTo: support@simsonn.com<mailto:support@simsonn.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Break pedal LED broke\r\nNo the led the other side is broken to the last inch do not work and if I put color on led its not working the right color\r\n\r\nI think we have to change bot led on the brake pedal\r\n\r\nLet met know\r\n\r\nHave a good Day\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvoyé de mon iPhone\r\n\r\nLe 9 avr. 2025 à 21:40, support@simsonn.com a écrit :\r\n\r\n﻿\r\nHello, I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
