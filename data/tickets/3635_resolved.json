When trying to bind the throttle and the brake in LeMans\r\nUltimate (and ACC) the brake pedal is trying to bind to the same axis as\r\nthe steering wheel.\r\n\r\nHow do I correct this behaviour?  Have upgraded the pedals to the latest\r\nfirmware upon initial install.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nTerry\r\n\r\n<https://www.avast.com/sig-email?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\r\nVirus-free.www.avast.com\r\n<https://www.avast.com/sig-email?utm_medium=email&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=sig-email&utm_content=webmail>\r\n<#DAB4FAD8-2DD7-40BB-A1B8-4E2AA1F9FDF2>\r\n\r\n",

In version 2.1.1, please follow these steps:    Click Revert    Then click Save    Finally, reconnect the USB cable    This process will disable the previously reserved Rx axis, which was originally intended for the brake pedal but has now been removed.  If the Rx axis is not disabled, it may still be recognized by the software, causing interference and preventing the pedals from binding properly.  Once you complete these steps, everything should work normally and allow proper binding.       https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",

If I disconnected USB prior to clicking the revert button - the revert button cannot be clicked.  I did disconnect the USB cable at this point which then disconnected the pedal controller from the Simsonn Manager and then reconnected the USB which then reconnected the pedal controller to Simsonn Manager.   After this I then opened game and tried to rebind.  The steering left/right are binding to the Y axis as always.  At this point - the throttle is showing up as X+ and the brake is showing up as Y axis (which is still in conflict with steering).  I have also tried deleting the LeMans Ultimate direct input.json config file in steam so that it would have to be recreated.     Not sure if I have explained my situation properly - If you need any clarification please let me know.     Regards     Terry",

I have a screen shot of the\r\ncontrols binding in LeMans Ultimate.The brake is now mapping to the Y+ axis\r\nand Throttle is mapping to X+    The steering right is also mapped to X+\r\nbut it is not causing any problems.  Not sure if I still have issues as I\r\nwould not think that having throttle and steering mapped to same axis makes\r\nsense.\r\nIf you would still like to remote in I can do that tomorrow night.
