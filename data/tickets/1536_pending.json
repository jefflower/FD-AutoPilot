  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just purchased the SIMSONN PLUS X Sim Racing Pedals, which contains the brake and throttle pedals only (no clutch). Will the VAM pro 2cps work for this setup? When looking at the fittings, it seems to be for the clutch and throttle/break? So I'm not sure if  this is the right thing. Or do I have to buy the 3 pcs? But since I don't have the clutch, it seems like a waste of money. Please clarify or make new recommendations.\r\nThanks,\r\nSebastien\r\n\r\n\r\n",
