  "description_text": "Hello\r\n\r\nMy van pro haptics keep disconnecting from sinhub.  I have to restart my\r\ncomputer to get them to reconnect.   Once they disconnect that haptics stay\r\non (vibrate) in whatever position they were in until the computer is\r\nrestarted and connect back to sim hub.  Even when the computer is off they\r\nwill still vibrate.   I'm running simhub 9.10.3 and simsonn manager 2.1.0.\r\nI have had the haptics for a few months and it just started doing this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBrian Pinnow\r\n769-8354\r\n\r\n",

If your computer cannot safely connect to the household ground via a three-prong plug, you can prepare an additional wire to connect one end of the controller casing to the computer case and the other end to the pedal’s metal screw. Please note that paint may affect the connection.
