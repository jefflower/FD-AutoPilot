  "description_text": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nSimsonn Official Store on AliExpress\r\nOrder ID:  1114304356501062\r\nTracking No: 882628894934\r\nItem: Simsonn Black Plus X P2-H2\r\n\r\nYesterday, Fedex emailed me and requesting for a screenshot of proof of\r\npayment and aliexpress order confirmation from the app, I have sent them\r\nright away, not knowing that they have attatched a sales invoice from the\r\nstore. To my surprise it was declared for a lower value $68 (₱3841). It was\r\nway under valued. You guys didn’t ask my permission to be like that. Here\r\nin Philippines if the item was below $180 (₱10000), I will not pay for an\r\nimport tax and I do not know why you guys undervalued my item. I’ve sent\r\nthem my online banking receipt showing that it was $150 (₱8524). Now\r\nthere’s a discrepancy which will take the shipping longer. I will attached\r\nthe screenshot of the current status of the package and I am requesting for\r\nyou guys to correct the value of my order so it can be clear from the\r\ncustoms as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nWillbert Oanes (A1RMAX GT)\r\n\r\n",
