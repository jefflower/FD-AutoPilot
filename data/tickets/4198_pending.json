  "description_text": "Rating: 4 | Review Text: Good value for money but it flexes under pressure. The plate feels heavy and well made. No sharp edges. The item was packed well. Only issue is that it flexes with heavy braking. I have purchased aluminium trunking to fix underneath to stop the flexing. This should solve the problem at a low cost. The plate is fixed in 4 places on a Si Turnbull rig.\r\n\r\nI would still recommend this plate. I will also update this review if possible once the modifications have been done. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ This review was automatically published.Learn more Nice Work!
