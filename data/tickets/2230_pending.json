  "subject": "Feature Suggestion: Resettable Max Pressure Readout",
  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt would be really useful if, next to the current brake pressure readout in\r\nthe Simsonn Manager (and ideally also for throttle and clutch), you\r\nincluded a resettable “max pressure/input” value.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to do a few laps and see the peak pressure actually hit\r\nduring driving, rather than trying to guess what we think we’re doing in\r\nthe menu or under test conditions. Perfect for fine-tuning the “Max Force”\r\nvalue or catching under/overbraking without needing to dig through\r\ntelemetry.\r\n\r\nSimple button to reset max value, ideally per pedal.\r\n\r\nThanks – keep up the great work!\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
