      "body_text": "Hi Jordan Newman,  When you received the VAM units, were there two that did not work right away? This situation is very rare, as we conduct 100% testing before shipping to ensure every unit works properly. Please try swapping the two VAM units into ports that are functioning correctly. This will help determine whether the issue lies with the control box or settings, or if the VAM units themselves are defective. Doing this will help prevent a situation where replacements are sent but the problem remains unresolved. ",
