If I bought one of the new control boxes for the haptics\r\nwould that still work with my pedals? and would that allow me to use the\r\nsimsonn manager software, as well as the haptics?\r\n\r\nThank you :-)\r\n\r\nJoey Garcia\r\n\r\n",

What will the tariff charge\r\nbe? if you are able to check or confirm that  I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThank you :-)\r\n\r\nJoey\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Jun 6, 2025 at 5:18 PM service@simsonn.com ",
