I’m currently setting up an Instagram page dedicated specifically to sim racing hardware, setups, and honest hands-on reviews, and I’m reaching out to explore the possibility of a review collaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m very interested in your Plus X pedals and would love to feature them as one of my first in-depth reviews. The content would include installation impressions, driving feedback, and short-form video content (reels/posts) showing the pedals in real use on my sim rig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the page is newly launched, it already has almost 800 followers, and my goal is to grow it through consistent, high-quality sim racing content and transparent reviews. I believe your Plus X pedals would be a strong fit for both my setup and my audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf sending a review unit isn’t possible, I’d also be happy to discuss a discounted unit in exchange for coverage or any other collaboration format you’d prefer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d be glad to share analytics or outline the exact content plan if helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nDouglas\r\n\r\nInstagram: @douglasbassett_10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
