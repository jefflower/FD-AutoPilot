Can the cable be cut and spliced like a speaker cable?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks, Scott\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPad\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Scott Zeeb,    The connection is actually quite simple — the vibration motor has only two wires: a red wire (positive) and a black wire (negative). Just connect them correctly and insulate the joint properly with electrical tape to ensure there’s no short circuit.  If you prefer us to send a replacement power cable, it would be a bit more complicated, as it requires disassembling the housing, resoldering the internal wiring, and reapplying adhesive for sealing, which makes the process more involved.",
