      "body_text": "Hi scott saliger,  Please uninstall the old version from your computer, then reinstall version 2.1.2 and update the firmware. After the update, the device version should display as CPU1: 2.0.5, CPU2: 2.0.3. If the issue still persists, please feel free to contact me.     Please follow the steps below to start the firmware update process:    Press the upgrade button on the control box.    Reconnect the USB cable.    The software will display a prompt indicating it has entered “Simsonn Flasher Mode.”    Go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu to update the firmware.    After the update is complete, release the upgrade button.    Finally, test and recalibrate your pedals.          https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
