Windows detects it correctly as SIMSONN-HB, but in Simsonn Manager\r\nI can’t configure it — the Handbrake tab does nothing and I don’t see a way\r\nto select the handbrake as the active device.\r\n\r\nShould the SIMSONN-HB appear as a selectable device in Simsonn Manager, and\r\nif so, how is it configured?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTomas Lindstrom\r\n\r\n",

Please use a toothpick to gently push it to the other side, then reconnect the USB cable. The device will enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → handbrake-firmware → handbrake-hbpro.sfu in the software, and complete the update. After the upgrade, make sure to switch the recovery button back to its original position. You may also use the VKB tool to check the device connection status. ww",
