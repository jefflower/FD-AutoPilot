They are\r\nconnected to the PC via a USB extension cable and installed on a GT Omega\r\nART cockpit.\r\n\r\nCould you please let me know what steps I can take to troubleshoot the\r\nproblem or offer me a solution to this connection issue?\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nFelix\r\n\r\n",
