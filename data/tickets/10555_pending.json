  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Team,\r\nI have just placed order #SSN5982 for Plus X P2-H2 / Black / Baseplate\r\nI am located in Amman, Jordan. I have chosen the fastest shipping: express shipping in my order.\r\nI would like to request that this order be shipped specifically via DHL Express. DHL provides the most reliable customs clearance for my country, and I want to ensure the flat-rate duty for items under 200 JOD is handled correctly.\r\nPlease confirm once the tracking number is available.\r\nThank you,\r\nLayth\r\n\r\n",

The original invoice I paid was below 200JOD and that is the reason I got from your site. In my country anything above 200JOD gets 50%+ customs on it, so I cannot risk that situation.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if possible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLayth\r\n\r\n\r\nGet Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n________________________________\r\n",
