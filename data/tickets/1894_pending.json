I purchased the control box because I was under impression it was needed for the VAM motors to work.  I picked up the upgrade kit because those parts are also compatible. If my thinking is off, please let me know, but I really appreciate you reaching out. \r\n\r\nChris Powell\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n> ",
