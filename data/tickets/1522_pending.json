  "description_text": "Heyo!\r\n\r\nI recently received my order of Vam Pro reactors, I have plugged them into\r\nmy Pro X base, and plugged the power cord in as well. When I open the\r\nSimsonn software and the SimHub software, the reactors are visible, but I\r\nam unable to get any vibrations out of them when using the\r\navailable testing buttons. I also attempted it in a handful of games, and\r\nnon of them are triggering the haptics either. Any help would be greatly\r\nappreciated. Thank you!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJacob Pedigo\r\n\r\n",
