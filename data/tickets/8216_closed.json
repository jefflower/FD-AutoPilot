  "description_text": "Hello, I just purchased (from Amazon) and received the Pro X Ultra pedals\r\nand VAM PRO motors. I think there is an issue with the control box. The\r\npower cable sparks when it gets plugged in and that makes me very nervous.\r\nAlso the VAM PRO motors will only function for a few moments before they\r\nlose signal and don't work until the PC is restarted. They have not\r\ncontinuously worked for more than a minute. I have installed and\r\nreinstalled the software 3 times. Everything is updated. Could I have some\r\ndirection as to what to do from here.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDave H.\r\n\r\n",
