If the Pro X has entered the upgrade mode, you can press and release the upgrade button on the main control box, then reconnect the USB to return to normal mode. ",

I guess i didn’t need to order the second\r\nbox but i don’t understand why the website says i need the newer box to be\r\nable to run haptics on the plus x’s instead of the newer pro plus’s or\r\nwhatever the new black ones are called. I realized i can in fact plug the\r\nhaptics into my original box and run them off of that because before i was\r\ntrying to run it with two boxes at once, one with my pedals plugged into it\r\nand the other one with the haptics lol but yeah got it figured out man\r\nthanks for the response\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n*1x Grammy Award Winning Producer*\r\n*Contact: *\r\n*  Phone:* *(619)-733- <619%29-988-2716>1398*\r\n*  Email: georgedavidlee@gmail.com <officialskitzobeatz@gmail.com>*\r\n  *Instagram: @dontbeangrywithgeorge*\r\n\r\n*Production credit must be issued to \"Curious George\" - (BMI)*\r\n\r\n   *This e-mail and any files or data transmitted with it are confidential\r\nand intended solely for the use of the individual named above.
