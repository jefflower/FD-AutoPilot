The fund were removed from my bank account to pay you yet I still have not received any correspondence from you.  I am now very concerned about what is going on especially after spending over $400 on your product/services. Ease respond immediately.   I currently have the feeling I have been ripped off and I genuinely hope this is not the case.  Thank you in advance for your rapid response to my request request.",
