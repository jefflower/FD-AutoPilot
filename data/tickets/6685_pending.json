Is this something you can help me with? I have tried things I’ve found online, I’m ensure I’m using a direct 3.0 use at my computer. Software has been updated. If I disconnect USB and reconnect it works but stops after a few laps. I saw somewhere that I may need a ground wire but not sure where I would ground it to? Any advice would be great. \r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Ryon Remmers,     If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding      https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
