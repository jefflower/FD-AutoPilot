Please try plugging the device directly into a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC, and avoid using any USB hubs. Also, check whether the LED indicator on the main controller lights up. After that, please send me a screenshot of the FreeJoy connection status page. Once I review it, I will get back to you with a solution as soon as possible.",

This has to be a failure of the control box. ",
