However, since I selected express shipping specifically to receive the pedals before January 4th, and this was unfortunately not possible due to the delay, I would like to kindly request a refund of the express shipping cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this can be arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nFelix Walkenstrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
