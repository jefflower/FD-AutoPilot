  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am interested in purchasing a Simsonn Plus X. I live in an EU\r\ncountry (Portugal), so I would like to know where the package would be\r\nshipped from. I have read that Simsonn has at least one warehouse in\r\nthe EU and is working on building another. So, if I buy from the\r\nsimsonn.com website, will it be shipped from within the EU?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJosé\r\n\r\n",
