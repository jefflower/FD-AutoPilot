      "body_text": "Hi Jan Jozef Sag,     Could you please provide your order number and let me know which pedal model you’re using?  If you mount the main control box onto the metal pedal frame, it can also help reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference). However, please note that painted surfaces may affect grounding, so make sure the grounding point contacts bare metal.  Additionally, the VAM Pro package should include nylon screws and spacers. You can use them to electrically isolate the motor from the bracket, which effectively reduces vibration and interference. I can send you a reference link to show the recommended installation method.         https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
