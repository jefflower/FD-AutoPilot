  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support Team,  I am writing to request technical support regarding an issue with my Simsonn VAM Haptic Pedals Reactor, purchased on Amazon on September 4, 2025.  One of the haptic motors has stopped working, while the other motor is functioning normally. I have already checked all wiring and connections and verified that the issue is not software-related. Based on my troubleshooting, it appears that one haptic motor has failed.  I would appreciate your technical support to further diagnose the issue. If the problem cannot be resolved through troubleshooting, I would like to request warranty assistance, such as a replacement motor or product replacement, if applicable.  Please let me know what information you need from me (order number, photos, video, or diagnostic steps) so we can proceed.  Thank you for your support. I look forward to your response.  Best regards, Terence L",
