      "body_text": "Hi Fco Javier Romero Ruiz,    Pro X Ultra and Plus X are our two latest pedals. The Pro X Ultra pedal is Simsonn's flagship product, featuring an adjustable hydraulic damper and more advanced electronic components within the control unit. It delivers precise control, making it ideal for experienced players seeking fine-tuned adjustments. Equipped with an RGB system that provides feedback based on in-game telemetry data, it boasts a more aesthetically pleasing lighting design and form factor to enhance the overall atmosphere. However, should these features be unnecessary, the Plus X pedal offers superior value for money – employing the same high-quality elastomer, a 200kg sensor, and equally robust construction.  https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-plus-x-pedals",
