If it is a ProX pedal, you will need to download SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0, then go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu After the update is complete, unplug and reconnect both the USB and the power supply, then test again. It should work properly after this process. ",
