  "description_text": "Hello,\r\nLast week I have received this shifter. Connected and tested yesterday and found that it is not working properlly - especially 5th, 6th and REVERS gears. Shifter is in the middle (N) position, but in Simsonn software it shows that shifter is in REVERSE gear. When selecting 6th gear, it engages into REVERSE.\r\nAttaching some pictures and small videos to explain what is the issue.\r\nI would like to send it back and get a refund.\r\nWaiting for you feedback.\r\nSincerely,Andrej Fiodorov\r\n",

We have applied code fixes to the v2.1.3 build on our website. Even if your local version shows v2.1.3, the official site version has been updated. Also, if the gear positions are incorrect, recalibrating usually resolves the issue. ",
