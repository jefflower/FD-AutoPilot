Aside from requiring my own mounting solution, will the haptic system work with my fanatec pedals/wheelbase? \r\n   \r\n Would I just use the Simsonn control box for the haptic motors? Any help/confirmation would be great, and I will place my order once I’m confident they will work for me. \r\n   \r\n Thank you! \r\n   \r\n Cam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
