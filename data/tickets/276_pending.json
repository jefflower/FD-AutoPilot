  "description_text": "Good day!\r\n\r\nI recently purchased Simsonn pro X pedals from alibaba.com. \r\nI found out that it is the model with only 2 elastomers (yes it was my fault, I was searching for the pro X ultra with 3 elastomers but kinda got stuck searching for the lowest price and forgot to really look what I bought). \r\n\r\nSo now for my question, is there a possibility to buy and upgrade the (brake) pedal to have 3 elastomers? I guess I need to buy another iron spacer/plate for in between the elastomers and some new elastomers? \r\nDo you guys have some more idea’s or suggestions for upgrades to the 2 elastomer pedals? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nWith kind regards, \r\nXavier van Heerden\r\n",
