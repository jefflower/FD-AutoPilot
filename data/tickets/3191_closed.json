  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am contacting you regarding my order #SSN1771, placed on June 17th, 2025.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the tracking information, the package is currently marked as “object not located in the postal flow”. Today is August 27th, 2025, and the order has still not been delivered, well beyond the estimated delivery time provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please check what can be done in this situation? Since the delivery deadline has been largely exceeded and the package was not located, I would like to know what solutions you can offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to your urgent response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSebastião\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There has been no delivery attempt at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the official tracking information (ND639510831BR), the current status is:\r\n\r\n“Objeto não localizado no fluxo postal” – which translates to “Item not located within the postal flow”, meaning the package has been lost within the postal system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already contacted Brazil Post (Correios), and they confirmed that the package could not be located. Therefore, the information I received from you does not match the actual tracking status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you asked me to verify my delivery address. I have checked it carefully, and I confirm that the address provided in the order is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, the estimated delivery timeframe provided by both Brazil Post and Simsonn has been significantly exceeded. Given this delay and the confirmation that the package is missing, I kindly request that you urgently inform me how we can resolve this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am attaching the updated tracking screenshot for your reference and expect your prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSebastião Ferreira\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEm 28 de ago. de 2025, à(s) 12:22 AM, support@simsonn.com escreveu:\r\n> \r\n> ﻿\r\n> Hello, the carrier has reported that your package delivery failed.
