  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI’d like to order the VAM Pro haptics, but I want to confirm compatibility.\r\nAside from requiring my own mounting solution, will the haptic system work\r\nwith my fanatec pedals/wheelbase?\r\n\r\nWould I just use the Simsonn control box for the haptic motors? Any\r\nhelp/confirmation would be great, and I will place my order once I’m\r\nconfident they will work for me.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCam\r\n\r\n",

You may need to order the PlusX control box and a 24V power supply, and please specify whether you need a US, EU, or UK plug. The Fanatec control box will still handle the pedal signal output to the game, and the two systems will not interfere with each other. ",
