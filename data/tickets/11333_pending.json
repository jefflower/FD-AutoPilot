  "description_text": "Hi,\r\nI am contacting you once again regarding my order shipped via UPS (tracking number: 1Z144AW70406291380).\r\nThe package was shipped on December 19th and remained blocked in customs from December 22nd to January 5th, due to a wrong classification by UPS (they considered I was a business customer, while I am a private individual).No customs documents were required, and I finally received the package on January 5th, after 17 days, even though I paid nearly 40€ for express shipping (5 days maximum).\r\nUPS confirmed that only the sender can open the claim and request the refund of the express shipping fees.I have already sent many emails regarding this matter and have not received any answer concerning the refund.\r\nThis is my final reminder.I kindly ask you to open the claim with UPS and request the refund of the express shipping fees, and to inform me of the outcome.\r\nIf I do not receive a reply within 5 days, I will proceed with a chargeback request through my bank, including the full delivery timeline and previous unanswered messages.\r\nThank you for your understanding,Iona Fuentes\r\n",
