      "body_text": "Hi ​Me M.   Sparks are normal — the motor’s capacitor needs to charge when the power is connected. This will not damage the control board, and the voltage is only 24V, so there’s no need to worry. Our power supplies are custom-made by certified manufacturers and have passed multiple safety certifications. ",
