  "description_text": "Hello, i recently purchased and received a set of Simsonn VAM motors and one of them appear as “dead”. I have switch the motors around to different ports to confirm that the control box isn’t the issue (like SimracingCorner had), and I more then likely believe the motor itself is dead. The way I think this is because when the motor is at 30% strength, it barely works. At this power it is quite strong for the other two motors. And when this “dead” motor is at 100% it is barely noticeable that it moves. At 100% for the other two motors this is enough power to shake my whole rig. I received the pedals and motors two days ago (as of writing this) and the motor worked fine then, but that motor now may be faulty. I’m wondering more so about a single replacement motor or such because I’ve only had the pedals (Plus X) and VAM for two days. Thanks.\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
