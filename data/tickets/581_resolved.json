  "description_text": "Greetings,\r\n\r\nI hoe this message finds you well. I’m writing to inquire about the status of the order number above. I was curious if the inclusion of the VAM Haptic Reactor set has delayed processing? I noticed that the VAM Pro set mentioned  a release date of June 16th, with no mention of a release date for the VAM set. I presumed that they were already available.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if the VAM Haptic Reactor set in my order has caused a delay in the processing of my order.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJulio C. Chacon, Jr.\r\nj_c_chacon_jr@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n",
