If you're not particularly interested in lighting effects, there's no need to choose the ProX Ultra, which includes RGB lighting. You can also purchase the VAM Pro motor, and use it together with our SIMSONN Manager software or SIMHUB 9.9.3 for in-game telemetry. The overall experience is excellent. ",
