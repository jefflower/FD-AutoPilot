  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI hope you are doing well! I am reaching out to you regarding my Order #SSN5192 from December 23rd.\r\n\r\nI am aware that you mentioned production and shipping will take some time, I don’t want to put any pressure, simply would like to get an Update on the Order.\r\nAs I sadly have no Pedals available to me currently, I am sure you can understand I am looking forward to finally experiencing your Pro X Ultra Pedals and get back into racing!\r\n\r\nOne additional Information I just noticed, somehow the Name for the Billing Adress is not quite correct, it should of course be Alexander Lenz as in the shipping Adress:\r\n[PastedGraphic-1.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate, if you could provide an Update on my Order!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and best regards,\r\nAlexander Lenz\r\n\r\n",
