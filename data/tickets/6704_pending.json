  "description_text": "Hello, I recently bought a VAM Pro Linear Motor, but I'm having a problem\r\nwith them. Any vibration activates the brake sensor, so even when I'm\r\ndriving straight, the vibrations from the gas pedal activate the brake (in\r\nresponse to the vibrations). The same thing happens with the brake pedal.\r\nAny vibration adds input to the brake, rendering the entire setup\r\nunusable.Is there any way to compensate for this?\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Sebastian Baran,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
