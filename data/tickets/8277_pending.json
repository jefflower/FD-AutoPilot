The unit \r\ncan be sent to our lab at the following address for evaluation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if available, we would appreciate receiving any technical \r\ndocumentation, SDKs, APIs, or other information required to manage the \r\nhaptic motors and calibrate the 3 pedals.\r\n\r\nEKSIMRACING LAB - Harry All\r\nStreet: 7 Allee de la petite plaine\r\nCity: Noiseau\r\nCountry: FRANCE\r\nZIP: 94880\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nHarry All | Founder\r\nmailto:info@eksimracing.org\r\nwebsite: https://www.eksimracing.org/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
