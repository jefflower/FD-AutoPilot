They are expected to be here this weekend, while the pedals\r\nare shipping from the US (where I’m at), the Vam pro’s are shipping\r\nglobally I think through SFexpress. I’ve been tracking my pedals as I’ve\r\nseen updates but my Vam pro shopping with SFexpress hasn’t updated since\r\nDecember 28th. My tracking number is\r\nSF6047206612732\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",
