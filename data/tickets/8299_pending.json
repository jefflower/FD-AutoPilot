  "description_text": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have just seen that you now have new horizontal adapters for the haptic motors. When I bought my pedals they came with the z shaped adapters which are not very good.\r\n\r\nI would like to get the new U shape adapters, and I just wanted to ask if there was any discount for buyers who have already purchased the previous set.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n",
