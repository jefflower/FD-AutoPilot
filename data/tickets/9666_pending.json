  "description_text": "Hello.\r\n I recently purchased the Pro X Ultra pedals with Haptics. I have everything installed and working. I use SimHub for the Haptics but i have also tried with the Simsonn software. The haptics work fine. I can test haptics and every works as it should. When i enter a game. Specifically AMS2 and AC Evo. When i play the games the haptics will freeze up and vibrate. I have to then unplug the Simsonn controller box and it will reset haptics. I have noticed that in AMS2 they will freeze almost as soon as i start to drive. In AC Evo it will freeze intermittently.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n   Brandon\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi brandon laplante,  If this occurs, it indicates that your PC’s grounding may be unreliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used in a grounded wall outlet. You can refer to the post below and connect the three metal screws on the PC case, control box, and pedals, which should resolve the disconnection issue.      https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
