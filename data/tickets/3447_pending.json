  "description_text": "You have a new 1-star review of SIMSONN from James Skeoch skeoch1984@gmail.com James Skeoch Display name: James S. pedals are good and still are but not pleased with the vam motors all 3 failed and they blamed me because i used speed telemtry, why offer telemtries u cant use in ur software or note it in the manual. Asked for the linear motors for the trouble so I can use telemtry and it was completely ignored . If they would've replaced the motors with linear i wouldn't be writing this but since that option was ignored and u sent me motors I can't use I feel ripped off because I can't do what's advertised Go to store reviews This email is sent for 0a6bb1.myshopify.com Unsubscribe \r\n\r\n",
