  "description_text": "Greetings.\r\n\r\nI'm playing with the idea of ordering a set of pedals from your company but\r\nI have a conundrum regarding where to order them from.\r\nThe options are between your aliexpress store or directly from your\r\nwebsite.\r\nAnd there lies the question, does your company have a warehouse and\r\ndistribution center in Europe for continental distribution, or would I be\r\nbetter off ordering from aliexpress where some  pedals are seemingly\r\nshipped from europe and deffinetly include VAT.  I am looking at Plus X\r\npedal set (aliexpress shows PRO X as shipps from EU).\r\n\r\nThank for your answer in advance,\r\nMatic L\r\n\r\n",

We do have a warehouse in Germany, but the Plus X in the German warehouse ran out of stock two days ago. The latest batch of goods is expected to arrive around the 7th. You can purchase first and note that you want shipping from Germany, and we will prioritise your shipment when it arrives.",
