The Ultra version mainly adds LED effects and 8-level hydraulic adjustment, while the current PlusX is already a very mature and high-quality product.  Considering that international return shipping costs are high and can even exceed the actual value of the product, I personally believe that there is no absolute need for you to upgrade to the Ultra version.",
