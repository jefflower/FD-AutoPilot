I\r\nwould like to order it on your website, but shipping time gives 5-12 days.\r\nIf I’m correct you have a germany warehouse, which makes the 5-12 days\r\nseems a bit long. In fact, the local aliexpress seller is written to send\r\nfrom Germany and takes a lot less time. What’s recommended here, also with\r\nan eye on avoiding customs costs for import of a heavy package from outside\r\nthe EU. Because if that’s being added, it’s cheaper to order the higher\r\nprices moza’s or simagic’s.\r\n\r\nSecond question, is there a possibility to replace the elastomers in the\r\nbrake with springs? And if so, what spring sizes and washers do I need?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nDave\r\n\r\n",
