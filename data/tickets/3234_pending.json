I would like to take the upgrade for the discounted price and the immediate shipment from Germany. Please make sure to include the Base- and Heelplate that were part of the original order and let me know how to send you the extra 30$.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nHarald Kessler\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVon: SIMSONN <service@simsonn.com> \r\nGesendet: Freitag, 29.

We can upgrade you to the 3-pedal version Pro X Ultra-P3-H3 at a discounted price of $30 and ship it immediately via DHL from our German warehouse. Alternatively, we can ship it immediately from China via UPS, or you can continue to wait until next Monday for shipment from Germany. Please let me know your preference.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, reply to this email or contact us at  <mailto:service@simsonn.com> service@simsonn.com\r\n\r\n  <https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/shopify/assets/themes_support/notifications/spacer-1a26dfd5c56b21ac888f9f1610ef81191b571603cb207c6c0f564148473cab3c.png> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
