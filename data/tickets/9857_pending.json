  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you regarding my Simsonn X Plus pedals, which I recently\r\npurchased from amazon. While I was very satisfied at first, I am now\r\nexperiencing a serious issue with the throttle pedal.\r\n\r\nThe problems are as follows:\r\n\r\nRandom Disconnections: The throttle pedal disconnects frequently during use.\r\n\r\nPhysical Sensitivity: I have to \"tweak\" or wiggle the cable connection for\r\nit to work temporarily, and when I do it sometimes shows 100% without a\r\nphysical input on the pedal.\r\n\r\nReconnecting the cable doesn't always fix the issue; the signal remains\r\nerratic.\r\n\r\nI have already tried recalibrating and ensuring the cables are seated, but\r\nthe problem persists. Since this seems to be a hardware or connection issue\r\ncould you please advise on a solution?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n",
