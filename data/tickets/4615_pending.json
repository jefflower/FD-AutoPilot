  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI’m experiencing an issue with my new Simsonn Pro X Ultra pedals, where I can only get ~23kg of pressure in Simsonn manager despite pressing as hard as I can.\r\n\r\nI tried running through some diagnostics with GPT, my short conversation might help you to see what the issue could be. Could I have a faulty load cell?\r\n\r\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/68e6c159-4544-800e-b351-5b7e2a5e80bc\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I’d like to confirm whether the wrong version was sent, which might be affecting the signal amplification and causing an incorrect kg display in the software — though it won’t affect actual performance. I’ll provide you with a reference photo for comparison.      If the resistor inside the red box is marked 473, we will send you a new control box as a replacement. Alternatively, you can send me a clear photo so I can confirm it for you. ",
