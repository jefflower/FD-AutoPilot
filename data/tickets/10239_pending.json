  "description_text": "Hi Dears,\n\nI am thinking of buying below set from the snapshot. I was wondering why mounting brackets are available for brake and throttle pedals, but not for clutch- it is not needed for the clutch?\n\nAlso I tried to place the order but in shipping page I have not found Poland on the list… can you tell me how am I supposed to place the order and what is the shipping time?\n\nLooking forward for your answer.\nKind regards\nMichal\n\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS.\r\n",
