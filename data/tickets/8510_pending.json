  "description_text": "I did place an order the 13th of November (#SSN3438).\r\n\r\nI purchased a full Plus X pedal set (silver) with VAM (3 motors set),\r\nheel-plate, spare U-mounts for the VAM motors and spare elastomers for the\r\npedals (green and white).\r\n\r\nThe first negative impression was on the heel-plate, all scratched and\r\nstained.\r\nSecond negative impression was on the brake pedals, the 2-way hydraulic rod\r\nhad a big scratch on it.\r\nAlso the clutch disappointed me, the sensor was misaligned to the pedal\r\nstructure, but at least it worked.\r\n\r\nThose were “not relevant” defects as long I was expecting all the pedals to\r\nwork properly, unfortunately the throttle input was not registered at all\r\nmaking the set unusable.\r\n\r\nHere’s proof of my statement.\r\n\r\nBrake hydraulic rod:\r\n\r\nClutch misaligned loadcell sensor:\r\n\r\nWear of the heel-plate/base (scratches and stained material):\r\n\r\nIn the previous communications I’ve been also asked to test the throttle\r\nand check the spring between pedal and sensor and made videos of it:\r\nThrottle check attemp #1\r\n<https://youtube.com/shorts/NV9xqEdVLoI?feature=share> - Throttle pedal\r\ncheck #2 <https://youtube.com/shorts/KgVSold8sWY?feature=share>\r\n\r\nThrottle pedal spring check:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 25th of November I received the rest of the order (U-mounts, spare\r\nelastomers), it had both items, but it was missing the correct pedal’s\r\nU-mounts, the one you see in the picture are L-shaped:\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking a recap, I received:\r\n\r\n• 1 Big box (18th of November) with:\r\n- Plus X pedals (throttle not working, clutch load cell not aligned, brake\r\npedal hydraulic rod scratched) ❌\r\n- Base plate (scratched and stained) ❌\r\n- VAM Pro ✅\r\n\r\n• 1 Small box and a small package (25th of November) with:\r\n- Spare elastomers for the pedals ✅\r\n- Spare mounting for the VAM Pro (wrong product, they are not the U-Mount I\r\nordered)❌\r\n\r\nYou no possess all the detailed informations needed, I sent a total of 15\r\ne-mails and even called the number displayed on the website, getting no\r\nanswer:\r\nCalling attempts <https://youtube.com/shorts/1zz0x-0fG2U?feature=share>\r\n\r\nI would like, if possible, to RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS on how to proceed.\r\n\r\nIf my request won't be answered or solved in a respectable amount of time I\r\nhave no choice but letting my lawyer manage this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIl giorno mer 17 dic 2025 alle 12:18 service@simsonn.com <\r\nservice@simsonn.com> ha scritto:\r\n\r\nHi Riccardo Busco,\r\n\r\nWe apologize for the inconvenience caused.
