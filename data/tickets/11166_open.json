  "description_text": "Hi,\r\nI purchased these pedals around a year ago, and they have been fantastic.. however over the last day or two i've noticed the brake has stopped working correctly.\r\nI have used your calibration software, and the throttle is calibrating fine, but the brake seems strange. \r\nI press as i normally would, and it goes to 70%, then drops to 50% no matter how much harder i press?\r\nI am on several facebook and reddit groups, and you have a good support reputation. \r\nCan you please advise, as i love the pedals in general, and i just want them back working.\r\nkindest regards,Simon.\r\n",
