There has been a problem with the\r\ndelivery, stating that the packet was oversize\\overweight and it has been\r\nresended to you (I guess). I have atached two screenshots from the delivery\r\nservice website, where states this problem and the new waybill number,\r\nconfirming that the packet has been received (by you i guess).\r\n\r\nOld waybill: SF6047082678264\r\n\r\nNew waybill: SF3295212713544\r\n\r\nAll of this without any update in the simsonn website.\r\n\r\nI hope you can solve this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nIgnacio.\r\n\r\n",

We can expedite your shipment using UPS, but customs duties will likely apply. Alternatively, we can wait until around the 10th to ship your order from the German warehouse. Would that be acceptable?",
