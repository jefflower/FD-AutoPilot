Will i\r\nhave problem with it if I adjust the travel? By now i have not used it but\r\ni will buy a H shifter in a few days.\r\n- Do you know any other possible issue i can suffer in the future with my\r\npedals model?\r\nMany thanks again :)\r\nAlbert\r\n\r\nEl jue, 25 sept 2025, 4:55, support@simsonn.com ",
