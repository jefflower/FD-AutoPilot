I’ll assist you remotely to check the pedal issue.  So far, we haven’t encountered pedal disconnection in our internal tests. Since your pedal includes LED lighting, the issue may be due to one of the following:    The USB port used is not USB 3.0, leading to insufficient power;    You're using a USB hub with too many devices connected, which can cause unstable voltage/current on a single USB port;    The USB hub itself might be faulty.    We recommend plugging the pedal directly into a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC. I will also help you remotely check the system and update the firmware if needed—this should resolve the issue, as it's very unlikely that two ProX controllers would both fail.",
