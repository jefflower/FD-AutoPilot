After connecting the device, if you see a message saying “Version too old, not supported” or Simsonn Flasher mode, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware-plus.sfu to update the firmware. Once the update is complete, make sure to recalibrate the pedals, as they will not function properly in games without calibration.        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdSWa1bxmbPksj9Hlzuo8bl7_bM8ixr/view?usp=drive_link",
