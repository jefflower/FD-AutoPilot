  "description_text": "Hello Simsonn Support,\r\n\r\nI am contacting you regarding my *HS Pro H-pattern shifter*, which is not\r\nworking correctly.\r\n\r\n*Exact problem:*\r\nOnly the following inputs are detected:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Gear 3\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Gear 4\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   S1 button\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   S2 button\r\n\r\nAll other gears (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and Reverse) do *not* register.\r\n\r\n*Troubleshooting already completed:*\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Tested on multiple USB ports (direct to motherboard, no hub)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Tested after full PC reboot\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Tested in multiple games\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Tested in JoyToKey (raw USB HID input)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Windows Device Manager shows the device working correctly\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   JoyToKey only detects Gear 3, Gear 4, S1, and S2\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Opened the shifter and confirmed:\r\n   -\r\n\r\n      The internal magnetic sensor board and magnet mechanism are correctly\r\n      installed\r\n      -\r\n\r\n      All internal cables are fully connected\r\n      -\r\n\r\n      This is a full H-pattern shifter, not a sequential model\r\n\r\n*Conclusion:*\r\nBecause only some gears appear at the USB HID level, this indicates a\r\n*controller\r\nPCB or firmware input scanning fault*, not a software or configuration\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n*Request:*\r\nPlease advise the *fastest way* to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nBen Barrett\r\n#SSN4240\r\n\r\n",

Please note that currently the missing gears do not appear at the USB HID level (JoyToKey only detects Gear 3, Gear 4, S1, and S2). I will confirm whether the new software changes this behaviour.  I will update the ticket with results after testing.  Kind regards, Ben",
