In general, if you are using a Fanatec or Simagic base, there might be electromagnetic interference. We recommend ensuring that your PC or base is properly grounded to your home’s electrical ground. Alternatively, you can also mount the control box securely to a metal bracket near the pedals to help reduce interference.",
