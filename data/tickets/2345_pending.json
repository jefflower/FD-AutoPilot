Setting the LEDs to a full color\r\n(green/red) will do one of three things: the last third will show as a\r\ndifferent colour (if green it’ll show red) some of the individual lights\r\nmay be a blend of the rgb typically orange or some individual lights being\r\nwhite. Last one will be showing the entire led strip correctly but if I\r\nthen turn those lights off it’ll hold whatever that last color was on\r\nindefinitely until the power source is removed. Checked the daisy chained\r\nconnector between each third on the back and they seem to be in solidly.\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick reply!\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 6 Aug 2025 at 02:01, service@simsonn.com ",

      "body_text": "Hi Chase J,  Turn off the Moza base power and test again. If everything works fine, then the issue is caused by interference from the base.      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
