  "description_text": "Hello Support team,\r\n\r\nI ordered the Simsonn Pedal Pro X Ultra on November 2nd last year and they\r\nhave been working fine until last week, when out of nowhere while\r\nsim racing all the devices that were connected to my pc (including the\r\npedals) suddenly disconnected with a windows notification that a short\r\ncircuit had been detected on the usb ports. The safety feature of my\r\nmotherboard shut off the usb ports until the defective device (which turned\r\nout to be the pedals) had been disconnected and the pc restarted.\r\n\r\nThe problem kept persisting everytime i plugged the cable from the \"pc usb\"\r\nport on the pedal hub into my pc. I bought a new USB A to USB B cable which\r\ndidn't fix it and I also bought an external powered usb hub, both of which\r\ndidn't fix it. After disconnecting the pedals from the pedal hub, the hub\r\nstill kept causing a short circuit while being the only thing plugged in.\r\nThe pedals, cables, pedal box and PCB inside look fine visually. I think\r\nthat the pedal hub is still the problem here. How are you guys able to\r\nassist me with this issue? Should I send the pedal box back to you? Or the\r\nwhole set including the pedals, just in case?\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nDaniel Woerde\r\n\r\nOrder:\r\n#SSN3192\r\n\r\n",

After this event the pedal control box\r\nbecomes unstable even without pedals attached. That’s why i thought the\r\npedal box shorts with nothing attached.\r\n\r\nWould it also be an option to get the whole set replaced, or do you guys\r\nthink that it’s still a problem with the controller box?\r\n\r\nOn Wed, 7 Jan 2026 at 09:30, service@simsonn.com ",
