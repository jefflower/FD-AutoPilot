  "description_text": "Moved my pro pedals (aprox 2 years old) to new computer.  Old silver style load cell.\r\n\r\nDown loaded your new software and the old style software to new computer. Neither work.\r\nOld software says I need v3.5  and firmware incompatible.\r\nNew style software will not recognize  the pedals as plugged in. I have no access to update firmware because it does not see that pedals are plugged in.\r\n\r\nThe pedals do work in I racing but I can not calibrate of make setting adjustments like I could with the old software on my old computer.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\n\r\nRick Debroisse\r\nSALES MANAGER\r\nPUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE\r\nStephenson Equipment, Inc.\r\n4210 Chambers Hill Road\r\nHarrisburg PA 17111\r\nOffice: (717)901-9070\r\nMobile: (717) 512-8604\r\nwww.stephensonequipment.com<http://www.stephensonequipment.com/>\r\n [cid:image001.png@01DBD6DC.F10B2430]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Richard Debroisse,  Please send us a screenshot of the software compatibility issue, and I’ll help you verify the problem. In addition, our pedals now have an upgrade kit that greatly improves the realism of hydraulic feedback and damping. If you upgrade to the latest PlusX controller, it also supports vibration motors — and we currently offer two models to choose from.      https://www.simsonn.com/products/plus-ultra-upgrade-kit",
