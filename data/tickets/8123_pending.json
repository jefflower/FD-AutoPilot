  "description_text": "Hello!\r\n I have your new plus X pedals. I have used them for a total of maybe two\r\nhours . Today I went to use them this time with the haptics motors and on\r\nthe simsonn app it shows they are connected.but when I went to play on Le\r\nMans ultimate or iracing it says telemetry not working and the pedals don’t\r\nwork at all. So I tried resetting the app and re calibrating and they still\r\ndon’t work on either game. I disconnected all the plug ins and plugged them\r\nall back in and still nothing. I then tried to unplug just the haptics\r\nmotors and play without them and  it still shows connected on the simsonn\r\napp but doesn’t work on either game. I am at a loss and need some help\r\ntrouble shooting to get them to work especially with the haptics as well.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n",

If possible, please provide a test video and send it to us via Google Drive, with access permissions enabled. The video should include both the pedal travel test and the haptic feedback test. Haptic feedback can also be tested using SimHub. Additionally, we recommend following the troubleshooting steps to check for any grounding issues.      If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
