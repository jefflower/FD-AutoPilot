That’s what I\r\npaid extra £30 for (express 3-7 day delivery)\r\n\r\nI have tried contacting simsonn support multiple occasions reguarding this\r\nissue and they just ignore the part where I have paid extra and what are\r\nthey gonna do about it.\r\n\r\nI understand there might be unforeseen circumstances for the delay but\r\nthat’s not what I paid for right..? If I am going to receive my order after\r\n2 weeks of placement then I have paid £30 for nothing. I could have gone\r\nwith the normal delivery option without paying a dime.\r\n\r\nAnd please don’t apologise either. That’s not gonna compensate the extra\r\namount I have paid.\r\nKindly provide me a refund for the delivery charges.\r\n\r\n\r\nPFA the needed screenshots\r\n\r\n",
