Then follow the steps below to update the firmware:      Press and hold the main controller’s upgrade button.  While holding the button, reconnect the USB cable.  The controller will enter Recovery Mode, and you should see SIMSONN Flasher Mode displayed in SIMSONN Manager.  In the software, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.  After the update is complete, please test the device again to confirm proper operation.",

The issue seems to be in the haptic power port in the control box.\r\nIf I have the power supply plugged into the control box the pedals disconnect and reconnect. If I disconnect the haptic power cable into the control box they work fine. There is also a slight spark that you can see inside the box when you plug in the power cable.\r\n\r\nGet Outlook for Android<https://aka.ms/AAb9ysg>\r\n________________________________\r\n",
