  "description_text": "Good morning,\r\nI just bought a set of the Pro Plus X pedals (Throttle and Brake only). They worked fantastic the first day, then after the newest Simsonn Manager update, I have about a 30-50% deadzone on my throttle. It doesn’t detect input until the last 10-15CM of throw cause major difficulties while driving. I would graciously accept some assistance!\r\nThank you,\r\nAustin\r\nSent from my iPhone",
