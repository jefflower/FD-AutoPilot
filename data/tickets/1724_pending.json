  "description_text": "I noticed that you purchased the VAM Pro 3-piece kit and the Pro X Ultra control box. May I ask what pedals you are currently using? If it's not a Pro X pedal, we'll replace it with a Plus X control box and refund the difference in price as they work the same for pedals other than the Pro X. And the Pro X Ultra control box may have compatibility issues with Plus pedals.  Since we don't plan to sell the Pro X Ultra Control Box separately, we don't have a packaging solution, and choosing the Plus X Control Box will make it easier for us to ship it in a package with the VAM Pro kit. And the Pro X Ultra control box may have compatibility issues with Plus pedals.",
