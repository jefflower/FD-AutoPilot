We extend our deepest apologies once again.\r\n​​I checked that your order was delivered on December 26th. Could you confirm if you haven't received it? If you confirm, I will help you verify it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, 10 Jan at 2:38 AM , Leonardo Kurtz <leonardokurtz@hotmail.com> wrote:\r\nWhen I try to track my order it says that it was already delivered, but it wasn't delivered.\r\n[https://attachment.freshdesk.com/inline/attachment?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MTU4MDA1OTQwMTcwLCJkb21haW4iOiJzaW1zb25uLmZyZXNoZGVzay5jb20iLCJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjo0MjA2MDM2fQ.hXMCOIw349jOI0lI7Wksa6rkVkAU2d0QoV1MwBr4XiE]\r\n10434:4206036\r\n\r\n",
