You can also test by using a 5V 1A or 2A household charger to directly power the pedal via its USB port. Under normal circumstances, the pedal lights should turn on.

All of our products undergo thorough testing before leaving the factory, and the LED strips were working properly at that time. If any malfunction occurs, it is most likely due to impact during transportation or abnormal USB power supply, which could cause a fault in the secondary chip and affect both the LEDs and the motors.  We have already sent you a replacement control box. Once you receive and install it, the issue should be resolved.  In addition, if you find that the brake force only reaches around 70kg, we recommend switching to the yellow and blue elastomers, which can provide a higher braking force.",

Please rest assured that we are fully committed to resolving this issue for you.  Based on our internal checks, every unit is fully tested before leaving the factory. A complete return at this stage may increase the risk of damage during shipping and may not directly solve the problem. From your description, it appears the issue is most likely related to the control box or the power delivery, which can be fully resolved with the replacement control box we have already shipped to you.  Once the new control box arrives and is installed, the pedals and VAM Pro haptics should function as intended. If the brake pressure still feels limited (around 70kg), you can replace the elastomers with the yellow and blue ones included in the package, which are designed to provide higher force levels.  We kindly ask you to allow the replacement to arrive and give it a try — this will be the fastest and most reliable way to restore full functionality. Of course, if any issue remains after the replacement, we will take full responsibility and make sure you have a working solution without additional cost.  Thank you for your patience and understanding. We truly value your trust in choosing SIMSONN, and we are here to make sure you enjoy the full performance of your pedals.",
