Please note that paint may affect the connection. This should resolve the issue.      https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",

This ensures that turning the steering wheel will not affect the signal. Note that paint may affect conductivity. The main issue is that the household grounding is unstable, or the wall outlet does not have a three-prong socket to properly support the grounding requirements of the computer and the base for interference suppression. ",
