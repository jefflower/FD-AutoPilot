  "description_text": "Hello, I have recently purchased you're pedals and I have to say I was very pleased with the way they performed. Though after only 2 weeks of use I have had many problems. Firstly the throttle has broke and the spring has come loose and therefore there is no input being register on the Simsonn app. As well as a part holding the loadcell pedals completely giving out while driving. I am always sure to be gentle with my gear so I don't feel i'm at fault. As well as having a travel problem on the clutch appear after a week of use. I would really appreciate a new set of pedals as I realise that your brand seems to be reliable with many other positive reviews and I just don't have the money to afford a new set/send them back to you. I have attached an image below of the load cell issue. Thanks.\r\n[cid:e47713fb-8b2a-4ffc-ab12-0dcc069798e8]\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Evan McKenna,  We sincerely apologize for the breakage of the plastic part on your throttle pedal. We will promptly send you a replacement part for quick installation. Previously, we used metal parts, but considering potential interference in customers’ environments, we switched to a non-metal material to isolate the bracket from affecting the sensor. Please provide your order number, contact name, phone number, and shipping address, and we will send the replacement part tomorrow. ",
