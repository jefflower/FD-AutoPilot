  "description_text": "Hello! \r\n\r\nI just received my package yesterday and I was surprised at how thin the box was considering how big the pedals are, so I opened the box only to find just the baseplate. I double checked my order to make sure I didn’t accidentally only purchase the baseplate somehow, but remembered it was $377 so surely it wasn’t just the baseplate. Can you help me find out where the pedals are? Appreciate the help! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
