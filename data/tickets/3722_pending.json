The brake load cell only goes up to about 14100 in Simsonn Manager. I can press the pedal as hard as I want, but it doesn't go any higher. It feels like it's about 60-80 kg at most.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could be causing this? Is it possible that the Loadcell is already defective?\r\n\r\nViele Grüße\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n",
