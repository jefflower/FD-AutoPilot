The throttle and brake both work great and I’m very happy with the\r\nproduct. However, the bolt lock for the brake pedal travel seems to be\r\nstuck, and I’m unable to loosen or remove it.\r\n\r\nI would prefer not to return the entire unit. Instead, I wanted to check if\r\nit’s possible to purchase a replacement rod, or if you recommend sending\r\nthe product back for service. I’ve attached an image for reference. The red\r\ncircle shows the screw that is stuck, and the yellow circle indicates the\r\npart I am hoping to replace or buy.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know the best way to proceed. Thank you.\r\n\r\n",

Additionally, if you wish to replace the damping, follow the manual: hook the bracket and lift it upward to easily remove the damping. ",
