  "description_text": "Hi team,\r\n\r\nI ordered my pedals on Dec 11 with express shipping but was delivered after\r\n11 days (today) and now I just set it up and plugged it in the computer and\r\nthe load cell seems to have issues\r\nIt’s very frustrating when the delivery gets delayed even after paying for\r\nexpress delivery (Note: it’s not UPS fault for the delay the item itself\r\nwas dispatched only after 7th day) and now the pedals are faulty.\r\nNot sure why I have spend £200 for\r\n\r\nEven without touching the pedal there is load being applied in the pedal\r\nI double checked and nothing is touching or not even near the pedal\r\n\r\nWhat do I do now ?\r\n\r\n",
