      "body_text": "Hi Alaeddine Khenissi,    Please use the blue USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC and avoid using any USB hubs. Then press and hold the upgrade button on the control box while reinserting the USB cable. SIMSONN Manager will indicate that the pedals have entered recovery mode.  Next, navigate: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.  After completing the firmware update, please retest the VAM motor to ensure it is working properly.        If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
