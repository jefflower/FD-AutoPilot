I’m using USB 3.0 and have tried various things such as firmware upgrades, but nothing fixes the issue. Please tell me how to solve this. I am using the full Pro X Ultra pedal package.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi n j,  If this happens, it indicates that the computer’s grounding is not reliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used with a three-prong wall outlet. You can refer to the post below: connect the computer case to the stand, and connect the control box to the metal screws on the pedals. This should resolve the disconnection issue.      https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/1n291hi/solution_for_simsonn_vam_pro_emi_issues/",
