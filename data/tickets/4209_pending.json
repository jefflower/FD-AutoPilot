  "description_text": "Thank you for trying our email marketing app, we truly appreciate it. Now that you have uninstalled, all of your Seguno data will be deleted after 2 weeks if you do not reinstall before then. Don't worry though, all of your contacts still exist in Shopify. If you were paying, the active charge has now been cancelled and no further charges will be submitted. Depending on your Shopify billing cycle, your next bill may still have one remaining charge to be paid. Lastly, no code is left behind on your theme so there are no further actions to take. Please reply here to reach our support team if you have any questions at all. - - - While Seguno may not be the best fit for you right now, we'd love to understand why so please reply here with some quick feedback. We've got a lot on our roadmap and want to make sure we're building what merchants like you are interested in. Thanks again! We wish you all the best. - Your friends at Seguno - 104 City Hall Plz Ste 200, Durham, NC 27701 © 2023 Seguno Software, Inc. All rights reserved. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
