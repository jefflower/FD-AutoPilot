Looking at the delivery time of 3-7 days, which terminates today, I wonder if there is any info you can give me on the status of the order.\n\nOrder Nr.: #SSN4742\n\nKind Regards, Jonas Roth\r\n",

It prompts me to log in, but I don't even have an account and signing in via google does not grant me access to the ticket (probably because its a different mail).\nCreating an account does not prompt me to set a password, only asks for my mail and name and does not send a verification mail to set a password either. Trying to log in then tells me I put in the wrong password (because I didn't set any).\nI can not access the tickets on the freshdesk support page at all.\n\nRegards, Jonas Roth\nservice@simsonn.com ",
