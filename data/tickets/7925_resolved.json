  "description_text": "Hi Simsonn Support Team,\r\n\r\nI’m having trouble registering my pedals and would like your assistance.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/23910970038552757\r\n\r\nI have a similar issue to the one shown in this video (referencing the same\r\nregistration steps). My setup uses the *Plus X Pedal Control Box*, and I\r\nfollowed the guidelines the image I attached. However, during the process I\r\nencountered an error message saying something like *“this is not an update\r\nfor pedal”*.\r\n\r\nAdditional details:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *SIMSONN Manager version:* 2.1.2\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   The manager can read my pedals without any problem, but I still cannot\r\n   complete the registration.\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   I am using VRAM Pro haptic as well\r\n\r\nCould you please advise on how to resolve this issue or let me know if\r\nthere’s anything else I should try?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nFrancis\r\n\r\n[image: image.png]\r\n\r\n",
