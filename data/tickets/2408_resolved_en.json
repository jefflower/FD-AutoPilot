  "description_text": "Hello I have a set of simsonn pro plus pedals I got from a friend as a gift. Im having an issue when trying to calibrate them and reaching out to see if there is a fix. The problem im having is the inputs are jumping around without even touching the pedals at all making then impossible to calibrate. I tried grounding the control box and pedals themselves to a plug on the wall but that didn't seem to help at all. Is there an issue with the control box itself?",

A high-precision pressure sensor is not an angle sensor — any slight movement or vibration will cause the value to change.
