      "body_text": "Hi Pit Biren,    Our PlusX controller, Simagic power supply, and Simagic motor are fully compatible and should work without issues. Please download the latest SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2, then go to Settings → Update and update the firmware to version 2.0.5. After the update, test the vibration feedback and make sure to enable the corresponding telemetry.  You can also use the latest version of SimHub, which supports more games. Please note that SimHub and SIMSONN Manager should not be opened at the same time to avoid conflicts. If the issue persists, please record a short video and send us the Google Drive link (with proper access permissions) so we can review it and help you resolve the problem.",
