  "description_text": "Hello, I got this all set up tonight only to plug it all in and the brake pedal does not take power. I tried it in other ports and nothing happens. The front piece with led lights also doesn’t work because that runs power through the brake as well. So there seems to be an issue with just the brake pedal as the throttle and clutch worked fine. Please advise on what can be done. I’m very disappointed that I waited over 3 weeks for it to arrive only for it to not work :( Alex On Dec 18, 2025, at 4:01 PM, SIMSONN <no-reply@loox.io> wrote: ﻿ Hello Alex, We would be grateful if you shared how things look and feel.

Also the left side of the LED strip on the pedal came unplugged/unglued from side so it cannot be fixed as I do not know how to reconnect that. But the pedal itself now works since I re plugged into the power supply. So only thing that is now “broken” is the LED lights on the left side of the brake pedal just so not work. Alex ",
