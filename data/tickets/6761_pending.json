  "description_text": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nOn aliexpress I ordered Simsonn Plus X racing pedals (Set of 3) where in\r\nthe picture of the option they are mounted on a baseplate. Then I contacted\r\nyou and you replied that the baseplate is sold separately.\r\n\r\n[image: image.png] [image: image.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between those two options? Since you already said\r\nthat baseplate is sold separately. Which means that also second option\r\ndoesn't include baseplate even though its on the photo of the option.\r\nMeaning: both options are the same, with both you get three pedals, without\r\nthe baseplate, just the second one costs 70eur more.\r\n\r\nI already canceled the order now because of this discrepancy. Please\r\nclarify the difference.\r\n\r\n",
