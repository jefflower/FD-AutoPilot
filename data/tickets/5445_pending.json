  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased 2 VAM Pro Motors for my pedals through aliexpress with\r\nthe same email as this. Upon connection I cannot get the haptics to\r\nfunction at all. The test function does nothing. I have the updated control\r\nbox but still nothing no matter what plug hole I put them in. I'd like to\r\nknow what I should do next.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nByron.\r\n\r\n",
