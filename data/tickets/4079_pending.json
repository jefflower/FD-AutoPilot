  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support team,\r\n\r\nI have just placed an order with the number #SN2724. Unfortunately, right\r\nafter completing the payment, I realized that I had mistakenly forgotten to\r\ninclude the mounting bracket for the Haptic Reactor. I actually attempted\r\nto add it to my cart, but for some reason it was not included.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I immediately placed another order for the mounting bracket\r\nunder the number #SN2725. I fully acknowledge that this was my mistake.\r\nHowever, I kindly ask if it would be possible to refund the shipping cost\r\nthat was applied to the second order. If this is not possible, I completely\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I would greatly appreciate it if the mounting bracket could be\r\nshipped together with my Haptic Reactor in the same box.\r\nThank you very much for your time and understanding.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKwanghee Lee\r\n\r\n",
