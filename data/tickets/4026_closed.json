  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased the Plus X pedals (2 pedals - brake and throttle) along with 2 VAM Pro Haptic Motors.  I have a couple of questions/concerns I hope you can help me with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  The brake pedal is \"EXTREMELY\" hard to push and is very resistant.  When calibrating it in Simsonn Manager, my normal push only registers 41 kg of maximum force with the softest elastomer standard setup.  This seems very light for a pedal that can go up to 200 kg.  Is this normal and does it necessarily indicate a problem with the load cell?\r\n  2.  My VAM Pros show up fine and I can change the settings and test the vibration fine in Simsonn Manager.  However, they don't seem to be working or vibrating at all in the F1 25 game.  I'm not sure how to address that.\r\n  3.  My control box for the VAM Pro's \"sparks\" when I plug in the power cord.  This is very concerning ......what should I do about it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help and reply.  I'm excited to address these issues and use my new Plus X pedals!\r\n\r\nWarm Regards ~Michael Langert\r\n612-386-9636 (U.S.A.)\r\n\r\n",
