      "body_text": "Hi Simon,  You can apply a small amount of lubricant inside the damper, which will effectively eliminate the noise. Because our products are shipped internationally, and customs regulations for liquids and lubricants vary by country, including lubricant in the package would significantly increase the chance of customs inspection. For that reason, we do not include lubricant by default, to ensure smooth and safe delivery. ",
