Could you please take a photo of the items inside the motor package for us? Also, kindly check the back side of the foam insert to see if the two motor brackets, the quick guide, and the screw set are there. If these items are indeed missing after checking both sides of the packaging, we will ship the replacements to you immediately today. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n On\r\n Fri, 10 Oct at 4:03 PM\r\n , Juan Manuel O’Donnell <odonnelljuan@yahoo.com.ar> wrote:\r\n \r\n Is this a joke?
