  "description_text": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI placed an order through your website for the Simmson Plus X Racing\r\nSimulation package on Friday (12/12), but I just received a delayed text\r\nmessage from my credit card provider saying the payment bounced back due to\r\nan error in entering some card information. However, the message reflecting\r\nthe declined charge is for a total of $317.30, but the amount showing up in\r\nmy banking app is $297.30. Because of the slight difference, I want to\r\nverify that there is no existing order under my phone number/billing\r\naddress. I will submit a new order if you are unable to find anything on\r\nyour end.\r\n\r\nI remember inputting my phone number into Shopify, but I’m not certain\r\nwhich email address was used for the order.\r\n\r\nIf there is an existing order, it should be under this information:\r\n\r\nPhone Number: (714) 345-5518\r\nName: Emily Higgins\r\nShipping/Billing Address: 2850 Kelvin Ave, Apt. 417, Irvine CA 92614\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n",
