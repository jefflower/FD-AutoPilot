I paid  a lot of money for a product that has sat in a box for the last 6 weeks because your company keep making mistakes. My son feels like he's not had a proper xmas present because of this. The instructions clearly state 6 screws\r\nAre required but someone only sends 1?  Seriously? Please sort this.
