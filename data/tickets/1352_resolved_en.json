So, I'm trying to go back to the SimPedalsConfigV4 software, the one I had been using, and now when I launch the application, it doesn't detect my pedals and says 'device disconnected'... Yes, they are plugged in.",

If you want to switch back to the V4 version, you’ll need to downgrade the firmware to plus.1.7.1.sfu using the new software first. After that, SimPedalsConfigV4 will work properly.",
