  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn staff, regarding the above, I would like to inform you that\r\nthe product does not live up to its promises. Of the six holes in the\r\ncontrol panel, four are threaded while the other two are not, making it\r\nimpossible to properly attach the steering wheel. This defect compromises\r\nthe usability of the product, making it unstable and unusable without\r\nadditional intervention.\r\nSince I don't want to leave a negative review, given the problem, I would\r\nlike to know if you are willing to reach an agreement on a partial refund,\r\nwithout a refund return the product.\r\nI look forward to hearing from you. Best regards.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nID ordine: 3066086953999551\r\nOrder: 11 Dic 2025\r\n\r\n",

On the rear side, a 70 mm PCD quick release with threaded holes is required, so the screws can secure the steering wheel + hub + quick release together.
