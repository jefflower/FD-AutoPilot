  "description_text": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI have the SIMSONN Pro X Ultra pedals and are working perfect. But the VAM Motors (normal VAM motors, not VAM Pro) are not working correctly.\r\n\r\nAt first the VAM motors were showing fine in the Simsonn Manager, but the vibrations were not correct (sometimes the motors got stuck vibrating non stop, for example).\r\n\r\nAfter reaching to you and a firmware upgrade (you sent me a firmware update file via email), the motors stopped working at all. In fact, the Simsonn Manager is showing the motors as \"power disconnect\" and the CPU2 firmware shows \"not connected\"\r\n\r\nThe control box is connected perfectly, the provided power supply is also connected and i tried the USB cable without any USB hubs and nothing seems to work. The pedals work fine, the motors don't work at all.\r\n\r\nI send you a screenshot of my Simsonn Manager app. ¿How can i fix it?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
