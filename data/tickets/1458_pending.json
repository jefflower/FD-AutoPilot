  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI bought the Simsonn Pro Plus pedals on Amazon in March of this year. They came with the old control box so I wanted to reach out to see how I could get the upgraded control box for them?\r\n\r\nAlso, I have recommended these pedals to many of my sim racing friends since I stared using them. Thanks for the affordable great product!\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nWes Vance\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n",
