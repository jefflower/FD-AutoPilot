      "body_text": "Hi Kamen Krustev,    If your computer uses a two-prong plug (without a ground pin), grounding will be ineffective. We recommend connecting your computer to a properly grounded three-prong outlet to ensure reliable anti-interference performance.  In practice, after playing for a while, touching metal parts again may cause static discharge — in mild cases, you may feel a small shock; in more serious cases, static buildup in the base can interfere with other USB devices.  Please refer to the grounding instructions below to enhance stability and reduce interference.     Anti-interference Solutions: 1. Ensure your PC is properly grounded through a functional household ground line Some wall outlets only have two wires and lack a ground wire. This not only poses a safety risk but also prevents devices like Fanatec from discharging electromagnetic interference (EMI) effectively. 2. Use a wire to connect the metal housing of your wheel stand or base to the metal case of your PC This creates a shielding path that significantly improves the overall EMI resistance. 3. Connect a green shielded wire from the metal casing of the pedal control box to any metal screw on the pedal This ensures a solid electrical connection between the control box and the pedal to reduce signal drift and noise. 4. Use a USB isolator If interference persists, consider using a USB isolator to further block EMI transmission paths. ⚠ Note: Make sure all connection points are on bare metal surfaces. Painted or oxidized areas can result in poor grounding, reducing the effectiveness of the shielding.        https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting     https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
