In the “Settings - Update” section, click “Manual Firmware Update,” then navigate to the pedals-firmware folder → pedals folder → and select the proxultra.sfu file to update. This firmware will disable the 4th axis.

They have been working great. I upgraded to a new PC and reinstalled the Simsonn software. It worked fine for a week and then I noticed there was a firmware update available from late July. I completed the update successfully and now the pedals are causing interference with every game. I tested it with a joystick input tester and it is showing a signal on channel rX. Normally, the signals should be throttle on channel X, brake on channel Y, and clutch on channel Z. I have never seen any signal coming through on channel rX before. I think something in the firmware update broke it. Is there a way to revert back to the previous firmware verson? I have included a screenshot of the joystick input tester software showing the interference. Thanks, - Jason Purdie jason.purdie@icloud.com 2612:4206036\r\n",
