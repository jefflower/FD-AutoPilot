  "description_text": "Hello, I tried my new Plus X pedals today and the pedals are working ok but\r\nthe vam linear motors are not working and are not recognised in Simsonn\r\nmanager. I am using the latest Simsonn manager, I have updated firmware\r\nautomatically and manually finding the plus X sfu file in the folder. I\r\nhave 2 motors and I have tried plugging them into all 3 inputs on the pedal\r\nbox. I am using a blue USB port on the back of my PC. In Simsonn manager it\r\nsays 'power disconnect' in red and all the settings below it are not able\r\nto be clicked. How can this be resolved quickly?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nLiam Hutchinson\r\n\r\nOrder number: #SSN3335 (AliExpress)\r\n\r\n",

Please send me photos of the motors and the control unit installation for inspection. Also, provide screenshots of the pedals and vibration feedback interface in SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 so I can check the firmware version.  The latest firmware versions are: CPU1: 2.0.5 CPU2: 2.0.4",

      "body_text": "Hi Liam Hutchinson,     The images I received are incomplete, so I cannot confirm whether the 24V power supply is properly connected to the main controller. Please try updating the controller firmware. If the vibration motor still shows as disconnected after the update, we will send you a replacement main controller.      Please uninstall your current software version first, then download and install SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 from the official website link below.  Next, in the software, navigate to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals‑firmware → pedals‑plusx.sfu  After the firmware update is complete, run a test to verify that the functions are working correctly. Please perform the test again after the update.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
