You can try using either Simconfigpedals v3.5 or v4, depending on when you made your purchase, as the two versions are different.  Please send me a screenshot of the Simconfigpedals interface, and I can help you confirm which version you have and determine whether your pedals can be manually upgraded to the new software that supports SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1.",
