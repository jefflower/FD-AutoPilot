  "description_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nI ordered above, 2x VAM PRO, 1x VAM.\r\n\r\nI encountered multiple issues:\r\n\r\nA) 2 VAM PROs - one works to 50% of power of the other. Tried different\r\nsockets in the control box, mounting them on different pedals, still the\r\nsame . 1 is powerful, other mellow\r\n- I have huge delay using them with simhub\r\n\\- motors vibrate randomly sometimes and freeze for significant about of\r\ntime. Please look into below video. It's insane. Game is paused, I\r\ndisconnected them becaus couldn't stand it anymore. Even after\r\ndisconnecting/reconnecting issue persist\r\n\r\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/FumauE-fask?si=s_AnPA30Kdgjf1Lp\r\n\r\n\r\nI basically switched them off for now  it's just distraction as they start\r\nrandomly at times and don't want to switch off (doesn't matter wheter used\r\nwith yours software or simhub)\r\n\r\nB) I didnt receive any screws for mounting them. Had to use screws I bought\r\nwith my Simagic HPR but dint have enough of them. My VAM module for clutch\r\nstill laying around unninstalled as I have no screws to install it\r\n\r\nC) with motors I also got PRO X ULTRA control box. I need to recalibrate\r\npedals daily because inputs change randomly (never happened with my\r\noriginal PRO X control box). For instance - I'm driving and suddenly\r\nthrottle input goes only to 70% after 15 minutes of racing.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPawel Pekala\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Paul Pekala,    I’ve reviewed the issues you reported. Apart from one motor possibly having lower power due to a hardware issue, I believe the other problems may be caused by EMI (electromagnetic interference) from your racing base, or your PC not being properly grounded. Several other customers experienced similar issues, and they were all resolved once proper grounding was implemented.  You can download and install the Todesk remote support tool (no registration required). I’d be happy to remotely inspect your setup and check for configuration or interference issues with you observing.     If the software prompts you to register an account, simply click the close button in the upper right corner to skip it and enter the main interface. Then, please provide me with your ID and temporary password, and I will assist you remotely.     https://dl.todesk.com/windows/ToDesk_Setup.exe",

      "body_text": "Hi Paul Pekala,  I’m not sure if I made myself clear. If there is an issue with the VAM Pro, we will directly send you a replacement without any problem. However, for the EMI interference issue, you will need to troubleshoot it yourself following our recommendations.      To address EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issues, please follow the steps below to improve device stability and USB connection reliability:     1.    Ensure proper grounding: Make sure the computer is connected to a three-prong outlet with a reliable ground. Two-prong plugs do not provide grounding.     2.    Control box grounding: Use a green shielding wire to connect the metal housing (such as a copper post or screw) of the control box to any metal screw on the pedal. Ensure the contact point is paint-free and conductive.     3.    Base grounding (e.g., Fanatec / MOZA): It’s recommended to connect the metal part of the base to the PC chassis or an external ground to discharge static buildup.     4.    Avoid high-interference zones: Keep USB cables away from high-voltage power lines or adapters; route cables separately where possible.     5.    Use direct USB connection: Connect devices directly to a rear USB 3.0 port on the PC instead of using unpowered or low-quality USB hubs.     6.    Use USB cables with ferrite cores: If needed, switch to high-quality USB cables with ferrite beads to reduce high-frequency interference.     7.    Keep software and firmware updated: Ensure SIMSONN Manager and firmware are updated to the latest version, as some updates include EMI handling improvements.     8.    Use a USB isolator: If the above methods don’t resolve the issue, using a USB isolator is recommended. It physically separates the USB power and data lines, effectively shielding the control device from EMI sources.     https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LciAFDFWJ1w ",
