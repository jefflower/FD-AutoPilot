In the meantime, you can use the internal version of SimHub that I’ve provided. The official release is still undergoing testing and may take a bit more time.      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrSbAvCC5iyx9XgdRgSQV-hWpmDGkujc/view?usp=sharing",

Even with just the pedals in and no VAM's it was still being strange. However i have now gone all way back to 2.0.6 and the pedal firmware from march and all is good again. You have any ideas?\r\n\r\nIf you can let me know exactly what needs downloading and in what order ill give it another go, but I know VAM wont work in this version im currently on even in Simhub\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from Outlook<http://aka.ms/weboutlook>\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",

Then, download SIMSONN Manager version 2.0.8 from our official website and install the SIMHUB test version we provided.  After that, try using the setup again.

Assuming i then need to update the firmware too, should i do this with VAM pro's plug into box and powered or just normal without. Also then which file shall i select to use to update. I have the pro x (non ultra). Im wondering if there was a driver conflict with them or something like the firmware didnt update properly\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nKev Gregson\r\n\r\n\r\nSent from Outlook<http://aka.ms/weboutlook>\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n",
