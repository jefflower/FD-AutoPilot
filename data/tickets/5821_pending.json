  "description_text": "Hi\r\n\r\nPlease do you have a document on how to update my pedals firmware.I think when i got my pedals there was a cross over. I didnt get the ultras as they werent released however i believe I got the ultra box i think.\r\n\r\nIs there a set procedure on how to do the update and which one to do. For example the update button on the box (in or out or when to press it)and which update I do (pro x or pro x ultra)\r\n\r\nNot sure if it makes any difference but I am also using VAM. The last time i tried to do an update it ended up constantly conecting and disconnecting all my USB's on my motherboard\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance\r\nKevin Gregson\r\n\r\n",

Also, please uninstall the current software version on your computer, then download and install the latest SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2. After installation, update the firmware and test again. If the device frequently disconnects, please plug the USB cable directly into a USB 3.0 (blue) port on the back of your computer, and avoid using a USB hub. ",
