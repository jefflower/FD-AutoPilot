  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI Have an issue with my Simsonn Plus X Pedals. I recently just received the\r\nVAM & VAM Pro Haptic Reactors, I have plugged them in and started setting\r\nthem up on the Simsonn Manager software, After having pressed the vibration\r\non the VAM reactor plugged into Motor 1, the VAM vibrated for a split\r\nsecond before stopping & the USB being recognised as disconnected from the\r\nPC\r\n\r\nEverytime I plug in the pedals now, I have an error stating \"Windows has\r\nstopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)\r\n\r\nA request for the USB device descriptor failed.\" and the pedals do not work\r\nor get recognised.\r\n\r\nAfter the USB disconnected the control box that was included with the Plus\r\nX pedals became quite hot to touch.\r\nI have tried uninstalling the device driver, using  different USB port on\r\nmy PC & restarting my PC but the pedals still no longer work.\r\n\r\nCan you please help,\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRonan\r\n\r\n",

This could potentially cause a short circuit and overheating. Under normal conditions, the control box should remain cool during operation.  Based on your findings, we will decide whether to send a replacement control box, a VAM motor, or both. We truly appreciate your assistance and understanding!",
