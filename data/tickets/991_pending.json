I was\r\nunder the impression that I'd receive both items at once, but I saw\r\nmultiple cancellations of the shipment for the order, and now I'm only\r\ngetting one link from China. I don't understand why you will cancel the\r\nshipment after sending the tracking number twice and then sending one from\r\nChina, which will take even longer to arrive. This makes zero sense at all.\r\nIf I had known it would be this, I would have just ordered one from China\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nKokou Donald Daglo MBA, PMP, CISM, CFCM\r\nAlexandria, VA 22302\r\n813.570.2398\r\n\r\n*kokoudaglo@gmail.com <kokoudaglo@gmail.com>*\r\n\r\n*donalddaglo@gmail.com <donalddaglo@gmail.com>*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jun 30, 2025 at 6:53 AM service@simsonn.com ",
