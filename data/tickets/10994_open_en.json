The hydraulic cylinder of the accelerator pedal is leaking, as you can see in the attached video.\n\nGiven the short period of use since receiving the product, I wanted to report this issue to you and find out what solutions can be considered (repair, replacement, or warranty coverage).\n\nI remain available for any additional information.\n\nSincerely,\nIllan",

      "body_text": "Hi grosso illan, We will send you a new one-way hydraulic throttle rod as a replacement. Also, please note that our unit is a pure hydraulic damper, designed to stabilize the travel and absorb vibration/shock. It is not a traditional gas spring, so it will not auto-return by itself—this is normal behavior. Could you please provide your order number and the recipient name, phone number, and shipping address so we can arrange the replacement shipment?",
