As it has now been\r\nover eight business days, I wanted to check in with you to see if there is\r\nany additional information available about the current status of the\r\nshipment or the expected delivery timeframe.I am not in a rush or trying to\r\ncreate any pressure; I would simply appreciate any clarification you can\r\nprovide so I know what to expect next.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help and for your continued support.
