However, I must express my continued disappointment with how this situation has been handled. \r\n \r\n First, I was clearly promised a refund of the express shipping fee (USD 59.90) as compensation for the delay. As of today, I have not received any confirmation or refund regarding this. \r\n \r\n Second, the package was not shipped using express service as initially paid for. The tracking information shows it is being handled by Correios, indicating that a standard international shipping method was used instead. This directly contradicts the service I selected and paid extra for. \r\n \r\n At this point, I expect two things: \r\n \r\n \r\n A full refund of the express shipping fee, as previously promised. \r\n A written confirmation of this refund, including the timeline for the amount to be processed. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n I trusted your store and paid extra for a faster delivery experience, and unfortunately, the reality has fallen short of what was offered and agreed upon. \r\n \r\n I hope this matter can now be resolved properly. \r\n \r\n Sincerely, \r\n Sebastião de Sena Ferreira \r\n Email: sebastiaosf@icloud.com \r\n Order #: SSN1771 Em 10 de jul. de 2025, à(s) 6:07 AM, support@simsonn.com escreveu: ﻿ \r\n \r\n Hi Sebastião Ferreira, \r\n \r\n Sorry, your package was wrongly canceled due to an error by the logistics company resulting in a return, we have reshipped it for you on the 8th, here is the link to your logistics. https://www.yuntrack.com/parcelTracking?id=YT2518900706683259 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n On\r\n Wed, 9 Jul at 3:55 PM\r\n , Sebastião Ferreira <sebastiaosf@icloud.com> wrote:\r\n Dear SIMSONN team, \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n I hope this message finds you well. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n I’m writing to follow up on my order #SSN1771, placed on June 17, for the VAM Pro units and controller, with Express Shipping selected (USD $59.90), which stated a delivery window of 6 to 12 business days. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Despite your reply on July 1st, informing me that the first batch was depleted and that the second batch would be shipped “tomorrow”, I regret to inform you that as of today, July 9, the tracking status still shows “Processing”, with no shipment confirmation or movement. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n To recap: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n The order was placed 23 days ago. \r\n The shipping carrier (YunExpress) still shows “Shipment Information Received” since June 19, but no physical handover. \r\n A support ticket was opened on June 27, and I’ve received no concrete update since then. \r\n Meanwhile, I even received an automatic review request, despite the fact that my order hasn’t shipped. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n This situation is extremely disappointing.
