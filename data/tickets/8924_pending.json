      "body_text": "Hi Luca Cengia,    Please provide a side-view installation photo of the brake pedal. In addition, after adjusting the damping, you need to reset the Offset. Follow the instructions to bring the white raw signal close to 0%, then recalibrate the pedal. Once the pedal test shows a normal range from 0% to 100%, you can bind it in the game.  Regarding the VAM Pro, I will check the shipping status for you today. It is shipped separately in a different package.",
