  "description_text": "I purchased the Pro X Ultra-P3-H3 on AliExpress on 2025/12/03 and it arrived on 2025/12/18, but only the brake is not responding. The throttle and clutch are confirmed to be working. When plugging into the controller box, only the brake does not respond. The others work no matter where they are plugged into the controller box. When I contacted AliExpress, they said they would refund 6828 yen. I was told to contact simsonn to repurchase just the brake, and that there would be a small price difference, but I couldn't find the brake sold separately online, so I am contacting you directly. I've seen many reviews saying the brake is difficult to adjust, but if it's not a malfunction, please tell me how to fix it as soon as possible.",
