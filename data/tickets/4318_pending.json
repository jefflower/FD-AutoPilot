I tried updating the firmware, uninstalling and\r\nreinstalling the drivers, but nothing helped. I think the sensor is\r\ndefective, and I can't calibrate it because the gas pedal is completely\r\ndead. However, the brake pedal works fine. Additionally, the gas pedal's\r\nlight barely works on the left side, but it doesn't work at all on the\r\nright side. Here are some photos and videos:\r\n\r\n",
