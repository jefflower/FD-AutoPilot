  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to get a wider brake pedal plate? I love my\r\nSimsonn SPRO-P3-H3s but I find that the brake pedal is too skinny to be\r\nused both with left foot braking and when driving a manual car. I think\r\nthat this may be a good product for you as an add on to the pedal lineup.\r\nIf you are not interested in doing that, could you possibly send me a 3d\r\nmodel of the brake plate so that I can make one? I want to figure out the\r\ncurve to the face and that would be the best way! let me know what you\r\nthink of these ideas!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMichael Osterhaudt\r\nEmail: 19mosterhaudt@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",
