Then, follow the steps below to update the firmware:    If the software indicates that the version is too old, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-proxultra.sfu to start the firmware update;    After the firmware update is completed, release the upgrade button;    Finally, test the pedal and perform a calibration.    Additionally, please ensure that your computer is properly grounded.     https://www.simsonn.com/pages/download",
