I requested a\r\ncancellation earlier, but my request was refused on the basis that the\r\norder is “already shipping.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder EU consumer protection law (Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights),\r\nI am exercising my right of withdrawal, which allows me to cancel any\r\nonline order within 14 days of receiving the goods — regardless of shipping\r\nstatus. Since the item has not yet been delivered, my cancellation is fully\r\nvalid and must be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease confirm the cancellation of my order and issue a full refund to my\r\noriginal payment method.\r\n\r\nIf you have already created a shipment label, please note that this does\r\nnot void my right of withdrawal unless the item has physically been handed\r\nto the carrier.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for confirming the cancellation and refund within the next 24\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nSimon Berger\r\n\r\nsimonbergeer2@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice@simsonn.com ",
