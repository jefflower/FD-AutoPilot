      "body_text": "Good evening,\n\nHope you are well. \n\nI am having issues with my pedals, specifically when playing F1 25, the brake pedal does not register until pressed halfway. \n\nI have tried recalibrating the pedals multiple times but this has not fixed the problem, also looked at the in-game settings within F1 and this hasn't fixed the issue. \n\nThe pedal works fine within other games, such as iRacing, however, F1 is my preferred game to play but this issue makes it unplayable. \n\nI have attached a video to show the issue. Follow LED lights are set up to see the pressure of the pedal. \n\nPlease can you advise of anything I need to try to get this working? If there is nothing further to be done, I would like to arrange a return for the pedals. \n\nThanks,\nKayden\n\n\n\nSent from my iPhone",

Additionally, iRacing may require recalibration of the pedals within the game. Please check: if the pedals work normally in other games, then iRacing itself is not the issue—we also use iRacing.",

I really do appreciate the time you have spent trying to troubleshoot this for me and would like to say thank you for your time.",
