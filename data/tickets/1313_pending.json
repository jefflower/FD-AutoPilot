  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n  I ordered Simsonn Pro-X Ultra pedals and VAM Pro haptic motors.  They both had the same tracking number (FedEX 882343912056).  I received the pedals Wednesday but the motors were not in the box.  It says that Amazon.com is handling your customer service so I tried to chat and talk to them on the phone about this issue and they could not find the missing haptic motors or provide me with a refund.  They said I had to contact the seller.  \r\n\r\nCan you please look into what happened or send me out a replacement VAM pro haptic motor 3 pc?\r\n\r\nAttached is a copy of my order from Amazon.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n- Jason Purdie\r\n  206-351-4847\r\n  Jason.Purdie@icloud.com\r\n",
