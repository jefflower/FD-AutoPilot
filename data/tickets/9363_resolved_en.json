I am reaching out regarding my purchase\nof the *Simsonn Pedal Plus X (2 Pedals, White Color without plate)* on\n*AliExpress* dated *9th December 2025*.\n\nUnfortunately, due to a factory reset caused by a software glitch on my\nsmartphone, I lost access to the passkey and my AliExpress account. As a\nresult, I am unable to retrieve the purchase order number, which I urgently\nneed in order to locate my account and reset my password.\n\nHere are the details I can provide to help verify my purchase:\n\n   - *Product:* Simsonn Pedal Plus X\n   - *Purchase Date:* 9th December 2025\n   - *Payment Method:* GPay linked with TrueMoney Wallet (Thailand)\n   - *Proof of Payment:* I have the payment slip and receipt from TrueMoney\n   - *Shipping Detail:* Lumpini Place Narathiwatratchanakarin\n      - 200(473 55 Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra Rd, Chong Nonsi, Yan Nawa,\n      Bangkok 10120, Unit 200/82, Building A\n      - Oudom\n      - +66 95 265 60 30\n      - *Order Status:* I have not yet received the product.
