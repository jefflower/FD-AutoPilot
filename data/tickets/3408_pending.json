  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support,\r\n\r\nI recently received and paid invoice #3515604 from Slovak Parcel Service,\r\nwhich included an additional charge of €36.90 beyond the base delivery\r\ncost. Upon review, this amount appears to include a €30.00 cash-on-delivery\r\nfee and applicable VAT.\r\n\r\nAs per your previous message stating that you would reimburse a portion of\r\nany additional taxes or fees, I kindly request confirmation on whether this\r\nqualifies for partial reimbursement.\r\n\r\nPlease find the invoice attached for your reference. Thank you for your\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n",
