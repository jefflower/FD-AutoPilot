      "body_text": "Hi Jens Wellegehausen,     Please follow the steps below to update your pedals: we recommend downloading the latest SIMSONN Manager 2.1.2 from the official website and uninstalling your local version to prevent issues caused by incorrect versions.     ProX / ProX Ultra Pedal Firmware Update Procedure:    Press and hold the Upgrade button on the control box;    Reconnect the USB cable;    The software will indicate that the device has entered “Simsonn Flasher mode”;    In the software, go to: Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals → firmware → pedals-proxultra.sfu (If it’s a ProX pedal, select pedals-prox.sfu)    Start the firmware update, and once it is complete, release the Upgrade button;    Finally, retest and calibrate the pedals.",
