  "description_text": "Hello SIMSONN Team,\r\n\r\nI’m interested in purchasing the SIMSONN Plus X pedals from your website,\r\nbut I’m unable to select *Poland* as the shipping destination during\r\ncheckout.\r\n\r\nCould you please confirm:\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   Whether you currently ship to Poland, and if so, how I can place the\r\n   order?\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   If Poland is temporarily unavailable, can you offer an alternative way\r\n   to order (e.g., manual invoice / PayPal payment / direct shipping link)?\r\n   3.\r\n\r\n   What would be the estimated shipping cost and delivery time to Poland?\r\n\r\nI’m ready to order as soon as this is resolved. Thank you in advance for\r\nyour help.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMikołaj Kowalczyk\r\n\r\n",
