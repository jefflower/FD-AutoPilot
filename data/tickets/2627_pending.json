  "description_text": "Hi Team,\r\nI've recently purchased VAM Haptic Reactor Motors from Shopee PH and 1 motor just stopped working.\r\nI tried troubleshooting by swapping ports but still not functioning, the rest of 2 motors are working even when transferred on different ports. \r\nCan you ship me 1 Replacement motor please? As I don't want to go through returns as shipping takes a while.\r\nThanks.\r\nKind Regards,John\r\n\r\nYahoo Mail: Search, Organize, Conquer\r\n",
