  "description_text": "Hello there,\r\n\r\nafter finally getting to assemble the pedals, I found that there's probably\r\none \"Plus X Pedal Control Box\" missing. Initially I thought this wouldn't\r\nbe included in the pedals' box as I assumed they'd come with a basic\r\ncontrol box without haptic reactor support. That's seemingly not the case,\r\nbut then I should have gotten two of these control boxes as I ordered one\r\nseparate item as well.\r\n\r\nI don't really need it anyway, so could you please just refund the money\r\nfor the separate control box that I didn't receive?\r\n\r\nOh and let me thank you for these amazing pedals. They look, feel and\r\nperform great. And the haptics add so much immersion.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nDustin Koch\r\n\r\n",
