  "description_text": "I recently purchased a set of your Pro X Ultra pedals off amazon(Order #\r\n113-7131278-8740217).\r\nI paid $40 more for the version that included all accessories and the base\r\nplate / heel plate.In the box that was shipped to me I see only the three\r\npedals (throttle, brake, clutch), the springs, the elastomers, and the\r\ncontroller. No base plate or heel plate appears to be in the box. I do not\r\nsee how I am supposed to use these pedals without a heel plate, and if I\r\nalready owned on I wouldn't have paid extra for you to ship me one.\r\n\r\n",
