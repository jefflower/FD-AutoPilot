Probably with Vam pro\r\n\r\nI have two questions.\r\nCan you tell me if the next sim racing games are compatible with your\r\npedals. F1 24, F1 25, Automobilista 2, Assetto corsa EVO, LM Ultimate and\r\nEA Sports WRC.\r\nAnd second, do you ship from Europe because of tax and custom regulations?\r\n\r\nRegards, Davor Fabijanic\r\n\r\n",
