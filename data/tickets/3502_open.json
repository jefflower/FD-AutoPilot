      "body_text": "Hi Bobby Philpott,     Previously, our 8-level damper had significant differences in resistance. However, many users reported that levels 3 and above were too stiff to press. In response, we released a new lighter resistance version, allowing smooth and easy pressing across all 0-8 levels.  While there are still differences between each level, they may not feel very noticeable underfoot, though the difference is more apparent when applying pressure by hand. This is perfectly fine, as hydraulic systems are primarily designed for damping and cushioning purposes, and resistance adjustments are typically achieved using dampers of different colors and hardness levels.",

However, its main function is actually to provide hydraulic damping, which makes the pedal feel smoother and more consistent when pressed. If you would like to adjust the pedal force itself, you would need to change the elastomers. Please try to feel again whether the hydraulic rod is truly not functioning. If it turns out that it is indeed not working, we will arrange a replacement for you — please don’t worry.",
