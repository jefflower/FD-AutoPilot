  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI placed an order on amazon for Simsonn pedals. The order number is\r\n111-1837877-4569807.\r\nThe order was supposed to be shipped to me at 1427 E. Route 66 Lebanon, Mo\r\n65536 which is shown in the invoice as well. However, the track number\r\nprovided with fedex shows that it was delivered on the other side of the\r\ncountry in New Oxford, PA. The fedex tracking number is 886368904940. I\r\nwould like to know where my order is, and how this will be fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKyle\r\n\r\n",
