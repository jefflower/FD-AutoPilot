  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently ordered some pedals and a sequential shifter from you guys and\r\ninstalled the product manager from your website. Up until yesterday they\r\nboth worked fine with aero issues, but now they will not function. The\r\nproduct manager pics them up but they show no input when used. I cannot\r\ncalibrate the pedals and I do not see any input up or down on the\r\nsequential shifter. I am at a loss of what to do, I have tried moving usb\r\nports around, removing cords providing power from my metal chassis in order\r\nto ground it, uninstalling and updating the product manager, and wiping and\r\nreinstalling drivers. I am not sure what my next step would be and I would\r\nreally appreciate any assistance you can provide to me. Thank you for your\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWeston Fredrickson\r\n\r\n",
