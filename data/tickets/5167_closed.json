I have no reason to lie but I do understand you'll position so\r\nplease have some understanding of mine. When you all retrieve your product,\r\nplease just send me my refund. This is unnecessary stress,  i only ordered\r\nthem from all because Amazon had dates of delivery close to three weeks\r\nshipping out, but on yall's site it said 3 to seven days so that is the\r\nreason iam stressed now, no fault of yall's. But truly I would like a\r\nrefund.\r\n\r\n",
