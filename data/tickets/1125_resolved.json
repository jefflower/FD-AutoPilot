  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI think i have an issue with the load cell of my braking pedal. I ordered an simmson PRO X  P3-H1 pedal on december 2024. Number order : 23215169900102004\r\nI can full push the brake pedal with my hand and reach 100% on simsonn manager, i think it's impossible to do that on 200kg loadcell. Is it a defective load cell?\r\nCan i have an estimate for a brake upgrade kit pedal only for braking pedal + an haptic  kit   included vam pro,power supply and if nedeed control box.\r\n\r\nBest regards.\r\n\r\n",

The software should enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → Firmware → Pedals → plusX.sfu and try updating the firmware manually. If the issue persists, we recommend installing Todesk (no registration required). Simply provide your ID and temporary access code, and we can schedule a time to assist you remotely. ",

Please send us photos of your pedal and control box so we can confirm the model. If you’re using the ProX pedals, we offer an upgrade kit that can improve the damping and hydraulic feel. Additionally, there are internal screws inside the base sensor that allow for fine-tuning the sensor’s travel range.      If you're referring to the 8-level adjustable hydraulic rod strength, then yes — this upgrade kit includes a softer version, designed for users who prefer a lighter pedal feel.       https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-pro-x-ultra-pedals-upgrade-kit",
