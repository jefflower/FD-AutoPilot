      "body_text": "Hi Christopher French Jr,    This issue is caused by the RX axis of our previous handbrake not being disabled, which resulted in interference. You can try resolving it using SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1:    Open the SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1 software.    Click the “Restore” button in the interface.    Then click the “Save” button.    Reinsert the USB cable.    Finally, test to see if the RX axis has been successfully disabled.    You can also try using SIMSONN Manager 2.1.1. In the software interface, click the “Restore” button, then click “Save”. After that, reinsert the USB and test whether the RX axis has been successfully disabled.       https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
