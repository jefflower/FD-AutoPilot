  "description_text": "Hello,\r\nI received this order last week and now nothing is being recognised. The VAM units on the brake always engage at about 20% brake pressure for abs and lockups regardless of actual lock up or abs activation. It also vibrated over kerbs without this setting engaged. Cannot adjust lock up vibration strength - always 100%.\r\nToday the whole pedal system has stopped working and is no longer recognised by the PC.\r\nI suspect this may be related to the fact the control box sparks alarmingly when the power supply is connected. There is still a light on inside but nothing works.\r\nPlease either sort these many issues or refund me for the VAM modules and controller.\r\nMy pedals have been working flawlessly until these rather useless new additions.\r\nD. Thomas.\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Daniel Thomas,     It is normal to see sparks when plugging in the controller, as the three large capacitors for motor control are charging. This will not cause any damage to the mainboard. At the same time, 24V is within the normal and safe voltage range.  Please also consider the possibility of insufficient power supply:    It is recommended to use the rear USB 3.0 port on your PC for power;    Or use a USB hub with independent power supply.    Next, please follow the procedure below to update the PlusX firmware and check if this resolves the issue. In addition, you may also use SimHub 9.9.3 for telemetry vibration feedback. Could you let me know which game you are currently using?         Please follow the steps below:    Press and hold the upgrade button on the PlusX main controller, then reconnect the USB cable.    Open SIMSONN Manager 2.1.0 and check if it has entered recovery mode.    If recovery mode is detected, go to Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.    After the update is complete, test the device to see if it has been restored successfully.",
