  "description_text": "Hello, good day\r\n\r\nI purchased the haptic motors and I'm having a problem: when the ABS\r\nengages and I brake, the motor continues to vibrate even after I release\r\nthe brake pedal. Additionally, as you can see in the video, I experience a\r\nvery strange vibration when the ABS is engaged, which also affects the car.\r\nThe car in the game also starts to stutter, and my braking distance is\r\ntwice as long. Furthermore, you still haven't responded to my email from\r\nDecember 10th. Please refund me for the Z-shaped mounting brackets, as I\r\nhaven't received them, as I mentioned in the email. If the problem with the\r\npedals isn't resolved, I will have to return the haptic motors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n",

You can refer to the post below and connect the three metal screws on the PC case, control box, and pedals, which should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
