      "body_text": "Hi Fraser O'Brien,    It is normal for a spark to appear when plugging in the controller. This happens because the three large capacitors for the motor control are charging, and it will not cause any damage to the mainboard. Also, 24V is within the normal installation voltage range.  In addition, please also consider the possibility of insufficient power supply:    We recommend using the rear USB 3.0 port of your computer as the power source;    Or using a USB hub with independent power supply.    You can also try disconnecting both the USB and the power, then reconnect the USB first, followed by the power supply. If the issue persists, please feel free to contact me and I will assist you further.",
