It is already in the blue USB port. I have already disabled all  \r\nfirewalls on the PC. When I open the app, it appears like this in the  \r\nvideo. I can't click on it in the software and it tells me to remove the  \r\nUSB and put it back in. It stays on Simsonn Flasher and nothing happens!  \r\nThere must be a way. I haven't been able to use it for 3 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
