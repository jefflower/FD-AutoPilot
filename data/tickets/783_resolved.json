  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a set of Simsonn Pro Pedal Plus and I want to upgrade the control\r\nbox's software in order to use it in Simsonn Manager.\r\nThe pedals are recognised in the Simsonn Manager app but it says: ,, THE\r\nVERSION IS TOO OLD TO USE\".\r\n\r\nI did find on reddit this post  :\r\n\r\n\r\n  *The SIMSONN MANAGER can be used to upgrade the firmware of the Simsonn\r\nPro Pedal Control Box to version 1.8.0. The Pro Pedals can then be\r\ncalibrated normally using the SIMSONN MANAGER calibration software. Manual\r\nupgrade steps:*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*1.Download the SIMSONN MANAGER software and make sure it is the latest\r\nversion 2.0.6 (shown in the bottom right corner). Below are links to the\r\nsoftware and software calibration videos:\r\nhttp://download.simsonn.com/simsonnmanager\r\n<http://download.simsonn.com/simsonnmanager> Then, press the ‘Upgrade\r\nButton’ on the Master Box to enter upgrade mode.2.Reconnect USB: Unplug the\r\ncurrent USB cable and reconnect the USB cable to ensure that the device has\r\nbeen properly reconnected and the pedal enters upgrade mode.3.Manually\r\nupgrade the firmware: Find the SIMSONN Manager\\env\\firmware\\pedal folder\r\nfrom the software storage directory, locate the corresponding firmware\r\nfile, and start the upgrade.4.Wait for the upgrade to complete and please\r\nNote: during the upgrade process, don't disconnect, turn off the power or\r\nexit the programme, otherwise the control box will not work! In the case of\r\nPro X pedals, the LEDs on the pedals will turn off, indicating that the\r\nlight upgrade is in progress.5.When the upgrade is complete, manually\r\nrelease the upgrade button on the control box.*\r\n*6.To return to normal operating mode: Finally, unplug and reconnect\r\n  *\r\n\r\nYou do mention to ..press the* ‘Upgrade Button’'* on the Master Box to\r\nenter upgrade mode'' . Can you please point me to where is this button\r\nlocated? I have the control box attached in the picture.\r\n\r\n* I also did find a tab in the app ( SETTINGS - UPDATE- MANUAL UPDATE,\r\nPEDAL than I did select the pedals folder and the version ,, plus 1.8.0.).\r\nAfter I select the verios, a bar starts and says upgrading but it does\r\nnothing. Only disconnects my pedals from PC and I have to recconect them in\r\norder to work and again it says ,, THE VERSION IS TOO OLD TO USE\".\r\n\r\nCan you please help me a bit on how to upgrade the software? Thanks!\r\n\r\n",
