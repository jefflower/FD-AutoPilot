  "description_text": "Good morning\r\n\r\nI wanted to reach out to you to share some feedback regarding your pedals.\r\n\r\nI recently upgraded my Simsonn pedals to the Plus X Pedals. I purchased the\r\n3 pedal set. I also purchased the base plate to suit.\r\n\r\nThe pedals are suitable for my needs although I believe the metal could be\r\nfinished better to prevent sharp edges.\r\n\r\nI then decided to add the haptic motors to the throttle and brake. This is\r\nwhere I have run into some issues. I misunderstood the website and ordered\r\n2 haptic motors believing my current control box was suitable. Again, I\r\nfound it very difficult to understand what was required. I emailed for some\r\nguidance but never received a reply so I went ahead and ordered them\r\nwithout a control box thinking my control box would work.\r\n\r\nThey arrived eventually, (your postage service is incredibly slow) and I\r\nwas unable to install them immediately. I attempted to install them today\r\nonly to discover I do, in fact, need the upgraded control box. Now I am\r\nbecoming extremely unhappy and frustrated with my decision to purchase\r\nthese pedals. I have ordered a new control box with express shipping hoping\r\nit arrives in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nMy biggest disappointment however, is the fact that to finally get this\r\nworking with the haptics has cost me a total of  $468.20. This is for the\r\nolder pedals. For an extra $77.60, a total of $545.80 I could have\r\npurchased the Pro X Ultra Pedals. As you know this includes 3 haptic motors\r\nand the RGB lighting, as well as carbon fibre heel plate and is the latest\r\ndesign of the pedals.\r\n\r\nI can't help but feel my money would have been better spent elsewhere. I\r\nhave owned these since April and no longer have the original packaging. If\r\nI did I would be returning all of the items for a refund to purchase the\r\nupgraded pedals.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe you should make the website clearer as to what is\r\nrequired when upgrading these pedals and lower the price of the older\r\nmodels. I bought these on the recommendation of a Youtube content creator\r\nfrom the UK who spoke very highly of them. I guess I would speak highly of\r\nthem as well if I received them for free. I am currently building sim rigs\r\nfor 2 people and have been asked for my recommendation of hardware. I will\r\nnot recommend Simsonn because even though the product is reasonable quality\r\nfor the price, I feel I have been let down by your company.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nDean Merchant .\r\n\r\nP.S. My order numbers to prove what I have said are:\r\nSSN1291\r\nSSN1292\r\nSSN1607\r\nSSN2056\r\n\r\n",
