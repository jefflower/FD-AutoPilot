  "description_text": "Hey! I believe I was charged VAT twice. From your store prices and the FAQ,\r\nif the value is more than 150€ the VAT is payed on arrival to customs,\r\nwhich I just payed for (just got charged around 110€ VAT by customs).\r\nHowever, in your checkout, the final price doesn't take this into account.\r\nIf the order is more than 150€, I don't get the VAT discount, like I\r\nusually do in other stores (AliExpress, for example). The price remains the\r\nsame, wether the final value is more or less than 150€, which doesn't make\r\nsense to me.\r\nI just tested and the price remains the same for the same item, if the\r\norder goes over that 150€ threshold. So for a order that is 100€ you pay\r\n23% VAT on my behalf through IOSS and I wouldn't pay anything to customs.\r\nHowever, if I add another 100€ item, the total is now 200€ but now you are\r\nnot paying taxes through IOSS. So you ask for the same amount of money for\r\nthe same item, but now I would have to pay 46€ VAT on arrival, making the\r\norder 246€.\r\nThis does not seem correct, if you are not paying any taxes on my behalf,\r\nwhy am I being charged the full price?\r\n\r\n",
