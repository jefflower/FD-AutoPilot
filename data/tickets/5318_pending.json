  "description_text": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI’ve noticed an issue with my Simson — when I release the throttle, it\r\ndoesn’t return fully to idle. It stays slightly open, providing around 9%\r\nthrottle input. I wanted to check if this is normal, and if not, what might\r\nbe the cause or recommended fix.\r\n\r\nI’ve already confirmed that the throttle doesn’t snap back completely, so I\r\nsuspect something like cable tension, spring return, or friction in the\r\nthrottle tube. Could you please advise on what I should check or adjust?\r\n\r\n\r\nThx\r\n*Sylvio Hardel*\r\n*(+33)767877614*\r\n\r\n",
