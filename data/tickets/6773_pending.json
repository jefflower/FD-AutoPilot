  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn Support Team,\n\nI am writing to follow up on my recent order, Order #SSN3623, which I placed on November 19th.\n\nI selected express shipping for this order and paid an additional €30 for the expedited service. While the shifter from my order has already arrived, the Simsonn Plus X Racing Simulation Pedal with Haptic Reactor Optional - Plus X P3-H3 / Black / without Baseplate has not been shipped yet.\n\nOn your website, the status for the pedals is currently marked as \"confirmed.\"\n\nCould you please provide an update on when I can expect the pedals to be shipped?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJulian Sauter\n\nSent from [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for iOS.\r\n",
