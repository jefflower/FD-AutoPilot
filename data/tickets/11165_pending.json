      "body_text": "Hi 4c farm and racing,   Please uninstall the SIMSONN Manager currently installed on your PC, then download and install the latest SIMSONN Manager v2.1.3 from our official website. After installation, please update the device firmware to: CPU1: 2.0.6, CPU2: 2.0.4. Once updated, replug the device and test again. Additionally, we recommend connecting the PC case/chassis and the controller box screw/metal housing with a wire to ensure a common ground. This often helps reduce interference and can resolve signal dropouts/disconnections.   If this occurs, it indicates that your PC’s grounding may be unreliable, possibly because a three-prong plug was not used in a grounded wall outlet. You can refer to the post below and connect the three metal screws on the PC case, control box, and pedals, which should resolve the disconnection issue.  https://github.com/SHWotever/SimHub/wiki/USB-Issues-Troubleshooting https://support.gomezsimindustries.com/portal/en/kb/articles/understanding-emi-and-grounding",
