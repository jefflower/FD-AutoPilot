  "description_text": "Hi,\r\nI assembled the pedal (clutch, brake and gas) incl baseplate and connected it to my PC to test. The pedals are just on a carpet for this test. When using the latest Simsonn Manager, the USB device often disconnects when pushing the brake in the screen where you see the curves. Any idea what could cause this?\r\n\r\nBest regards, Oliver\r\n",
