  "description_text": "*Subject: Successful Pedal Giveaway & Proposal for Extended Product Testing\r\nCollaboration*\r\n\r\nDear Simsonn Team,\r\n\r\nI wanted to follow up on our recent collaboration and share some excellent\r\nnews. The pedal set giveaway went extremely well - the winner was\r\nabsolutely thrilled and has already received their prize. The response has\r\nbeen fantastic, and I'm expecting several orders to come through as a\r\nresult of this campaign.\r\n\r\nTwo observations worth mentioning:\r\n\r\n   1. Many viewers are choosing to purchase through Amazon for convenience.\r\n   It might be worth highlighting your direct ordering options in future\r\n   communications to capture more direct sales.\r\n   2. I've noticed that some customers are using the code \"Cart10\" (10%\r\n   discount) instead of my affiliate code \"Chuxl\" (8% discount). While I\r\n   understand customers naturally seek the best deal, it would be helpful if\r\n   we could find a way to make the affiliate code more attractive or perhaps\r\n   match the discount percentage to ensure proper tracking of our\r\n   collaboration's success.\r\n\r\nThe review video has already achieved impressive engagement with nearly 400\r\nviews, 30 likes, and 16 comments - a strong start that shows the\r\ncommunity's interest in your products.\r\n\r\n*Proposal for Extended Collaboration:*\r\n\r\nGiven this positive response, I'd like to propose expanding our\r\ncollaboration through comprehensive product testing. I would create:\r\n\r\n   - Unboxing videos\r\n   - Initial reviews\r\n   - Long-term reviews after extended testing periods\r\n\r\n*Products I could test:*\r\n\r\n   - *Pedal Pro X*: Comparison video \"Plus X Pedals vs Pedal Pro X\" with\r\n   unboxing, review, comparison, and long-term review\r\n   - *Simsonn HB Pro Racing Simulator Handbrake*: Unboxing, review, and\r\n   long-term testing\r\n   - *SIMSONN PC USB 6+RH Shifter & 7+RH Shifter*: Unboxing, reviews, and\r\n   long-term tests for both models\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've received numerous inquiries during my streams about\r\nwhether you have a wheelbase in development, as viewers have noticed\r\nsomething in the driver software. If this is something you're working on,\r\nmy audience would be very interested to learn more.\r\n\r\nI'm confident we can build on this successful start to create even more\r\nengaging content that showcases your products effectively.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to discussing these opportunities further.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nPierre Lorenz\r\n\r\n>\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Pierre Lorenz,     Thank you for your follow-up and for sharing such positive news about the giveaway. We’re very pleased to hear that the winner received the pedals and that the campaign has generated such strong engagement and interest within your community.  Regarding your observations:    Amazon purchases: Please note that orders placed on Amazon are not linked to our affiliate program, and customers are also unable to use discount codes there. Direct orders through our website remain the only way for affiliates to generate commissions and for customers to apply discount codes.    Discount codes: Even if customers use a different code, their orders will still be attributed to the affiliate link owner. This ensures your efforts are properly tracked, regardless of the discount used.    Wheelbase:Our wheelbase has already been developed, and we are currently refining the details. At this stage, we are focusing on thorough quality checks and after-sales reliability testing to ensure the best possible experience for our customers.    As for your proposal to expand content around other products, at this stage we do not have additional promotion campaigns planned. However, if new promotion opportunities arise in the future, we will be glad to prioritize you for collaboration.  We truly value the energy and dedication you bring to these projects and look forward to more exciting opportunities together.     Best regards, The Simsonn Team",
