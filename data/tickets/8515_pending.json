  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am writing to inquire about the status of my order. I placed the order on\r\nthe evening of the 11th, and it has remained in the “confirmed” status\r\nsince then. As I paid for express shipping, I expected the processing to\r\nmove a bit faster.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as I live in the EU, I would like to ask whether my order\r\nwill incur any additional delivery fees, such as taxes or customs charges.\r\n\r\nMy order number is #SSN4717.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\nKind regards,\r\nHuňady\r\n\r\n",
