  "description_text": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI am an ambassador in your program and I have one completed order made\r\nalmost 2 months ago.\r\nAccording to your rules, commissions are calculated monthly, but I still\r\nhave not received any payment.\r\n\r\nI have read your policy carefully, and I belong to the V3 level based on my\r\nfollower count (97,000).\r\nHowever, the system shows a 6% commission, which does not match the V3 rate.\r\n\r\nPlease check:\r\n1. Why the payment for my order has still not been processed after almost 2\r\nmonths.\r\n2. Whether my ambassador level is set correctly.\r\n3. When I can expect my commission payout.\r\n*Best regards,*\r\n* Alex*\r\n? *YouTube Creator – Nixon Game World*\r\n\r\n? YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@nixon_game\r\n?

Additionally, please note that the monthly commission payment threshold is $60 (if this month's threshold is not met, the amount will be carried over to the next month and combined with subsequent commissions for payment).",
