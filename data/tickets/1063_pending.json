Anyway my pedals came with a\r\ncontroller hub and it has 3 motor connections and you sell the vam pro set\r\n3 pack with power supply and without if i have the that hub do I need the\r\npower supply? And it seems that its cheaper to buy them in singles.\r\n Anyway any chance of a discount code please ?  lol or a special offer\r\nlike buy 2 get 3rd free lol im trying to save as much as i can as i need a\r\nnew steering wheel\r\n\r\nHope this message finds you well and thank you once again for these pedals\r\nim so looking forward to using them\r\n\r\n\r\nMark\r\nHave a nice day\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "Hi Mark Ryan,     Since you're using the ProX pedals, we recommend choosing the VAM motor instead of the VAM Pro. The VAM Pro's bidirectional control is better supported by the ProX Ultra controller, whereas the standard ProX controller has limited compatibility with that feature.  Also, please note that the VAM motor requires a separate 24V 3A power supply. If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to purchase it separately.",
