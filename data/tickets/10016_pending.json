  "description_text": "I currently have the Simsonn Pro Plus Pedals (Older Model) The one that\r\nships with the old control box. The only way I can customize the settings\r\nis through the Freejoy Configuration App.\r\n\r\nBasically I want to get the Simsonn VAM Haptic Pedal Reactors for my pedals\r\nbut my current control box doesn't have a port for them.\r\n\r\nIf I buy the new Control Box (Plus X Control Box) Will my current Pro Plus\r\npedals work with it? And will I finally be able to use the Simsonn Software\r\nthrough it?\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n\r\n",

If it is version 1.7.0, you can purchase the PlusX controller box. It supports Pro Plus pedals and also provides vibration motor interfaces.     https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-vam-pedals-haptic-reactor?variant=51351053533498",
