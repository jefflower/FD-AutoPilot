Then follow the steps below to manually update the PlusX firmware:      1.    Press and hold the upgrade button on the PlusX control box;      2.    Plug in the USB while holding the button — the device will enter recovery mode. Then release the button;      3.    Open SIMSONN Manager, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update,  and select the plusx.sfu file I sent you to complete the update.

Please connect the device directly to a USB 3.0 port on the back of your PC, and keep the USB cable away from power cables to reduce interference.     Please update the software to version 2.0.9 in the settings, and update the PlusX firmware to version 2.0.2. Then test LMU again.  If the issue with LMU still persists, please let me know, and I will arrange for it to be fixed.     Additionally, SIMHUB version 9.9.3 also supports our pedals, so you can use that as well for testing.",
