  "description_text": "Hello,\n\nI think I have an issue with the load cell of my braking pedal. I ordered a Simsonn PRO X P3-H1 pedal in December 2024. Order number: 23215169900102004\nI can fully push the brake pedal with my hand and reach 100% on Simsonn manager, I think it's impossible to do that on a 200kg loadcell. Is it a defective load cell?\nCan I get an estimate for a brake upgrade kit pedal only for the braking pedal + a haptic kit included VAM Pro, power supply and if needed control box.\n\nBest regards.",

The software should enter recovery mode. Next, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → Pedals → Firmware → Pedals → plusX.sfu and try updating the firmware manually. If the issue persists, we recommend installing Todesk (no registration required). Simply provide your ID and temporary access code, and we can schedule a time to assist you remotely.",

      "body_text": "Hi Fred Gourd, We couldn’t find your order in our system, so it’s possible that you didn’t purchase it from our official AliExpress store. Please send us photos of your pedal and control box so we can confirm the model. If you’re using the ProX pedals, we offer an upgrade kit that can improve the damping and hydraulic feel. Additionally, there are internal screws inside the base sensor that allow for fine-tuning the sensor’s travel range. If you're referring to the 8-level adjustable hydraulic rod strength, then yes — this upgrade kit includes a softer version, designed for users who prefer a lighter pedal feel. https://www.simsonn.com/products/simsonn-pro-x-ultra-pedals-upgrade-kit",
