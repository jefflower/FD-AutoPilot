  "description_text": "Good morning,\r\n\r\nI would like to know if you could help me optimize my brake pedal?\r\n\r\nWhen I calibrate my brake pedal in the software, I get a maximum pressure\r\nforce of 30kg. Is it better to leave the maximum pressure force as the\r\nvalue in the software?\r\nDo I need to enter 28 kg into the software to reach 100 kg of pressure more\r\nquickly and ensure I always have access to 100%?\r\nOr should I enter a little more in the software (for example 32 kg) so that\r\nI never reach 100%?\r\n\r\nPlease explain.\r\n\r\n",
