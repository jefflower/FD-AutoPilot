  "description_text": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been using Simsonn pedals and have been very satisfied. I ordered\r\nthe VAM Pro motors, and they arrived today. Unfortunately, after mounting\r\nthem and plugging them in, I can't get them to work.\r\n\r\nI have tried all the steps found on Google (upgrading software, firmware,\r\ngrounding the control box, closing SimHub and/or Simsonn Manager, etc.). I\r\nget zero power whatsoever to the motors, even during SimHub testing.\r\n\r\nI have tried both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0. Any other things I can try?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n*Tim Egorov*\r\n206.349.7996\r\n\r\n",

Once Simsonn Manager shows that it has entered firmware upgrade mode, you can release the button.  Next, follow these steps:    In the software, go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-plusx.sfu.    After the update is completed, connect the USB to the USB 3.0 blue port at the back of your PC, then plug in the power cable.    Test the device again to ensure it is functioning properly.",

Unfortunately, the pedals\r\nhad to be connected to USB in order to access “manual update” and begin the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAs such, I was not able to follow steps 2 and 3 exactly how you mentioned\r\nbelow. I’m not sure if this confusion is why your advice did not help, but\r\nsadly it did not fix the issue. I still see “Power Disconnect” shown like\r\nit was in my original email.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\n*Tim Egorov*\r\n206.349.7996\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Sep 12, 2025 at 6:16 PM support@simsonn.com ",
