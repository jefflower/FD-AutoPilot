I had problems with two of the vam motors last night. I've been waiting\r\nto use them since they arrived, because there were other parts of my setup\r\nthat I had to get delivered and they took a while to get to me. So I only\r\nset them up and used them yesterday. They felt really good and worked\r\nflawlessly for about three hours, and then the one I set to the clutch\r\nbecame very loud and the one on the brakes stopped working. I changed their\r\nconnection on the control box and they would behave the same at wherever\r\ninput they were connected. I really liked the vam system and the pedals and\r\nit was really a bummer that it worked for only that short period of time.\r\nHow can we solve this? It was really expensive to me and I had to save for\r\na long time to get this upgrade to my setup.\r\nMy order number is 8204864367111732.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCan you help me whith it?\r\n\r\n VID_20251028_121523614.mp4\r\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmGRswi2_V3ZZM8GKO8e-jiUzo3C7AUA/view?usp=drive_web>\r\n\r\n",

      "body_text": "I'm using SIMSONN Manager. I updated it as soon as I installed it. As you\r\ncan see in the video, I had Vam mode selected, not Vam Pro. Let me explain\r\nthe problem again: Motor 3 (clutch) is very loud, even with low force;\r\nMotor 2 (brakes) stopped working completely and Motor 1 (accelerator) is\r\nfine, working strong and quiet. After I removed Motor 2 from the pedal, I\r\nmanaged to make it work briefly by shaking it with my hand when clicking\r\nthe test button. It seems like it could have some internal bad connection.\r\nTo be completely clear: Motor 3 is loud when connected to whatever input on\r\nthe control box, Motor 2 doesn't work when connected to any input and Motor\r\n3 works normally and quietly when connected to whatever input, all of them\r\nusing the fully updated SIMSONN Manager and with Vam Mode selected, as seen\r\nin the video I included in my first message. That makes me believe that the\r\nproblem is really with the motors 3 and 2, and not with a wrong mode\r\nselection in the SIMSONN manager or even the control box.\r\n\r\nI hope we can get to a solution for this problem, because I really liked\r\nthe SIMSONN products that I purchased: the 7+R gear shifter and the Pro\r\nPlus pedals set that I purchased from a store here in Brazil, and the\r\nupgrade kit for the pedals and the Vam system that I bought from the\r\nSIMSONN Official Store on AliExpress, while it worked.\r\n\r\nEm ter., 28 de out. de 2025 às 23:17, service@simsonn.com <\r\nservice@simsonn.com> escreveu:\r\n\r\n> Hi Daniel Boaventura,\r\n>\r\n> Are you using SIMSONN Manager or SIMHUB for telemetry?\r\n> Also, please select the *VAM motor type* for testing.\r\n> From the sound of the motor, it doesn’t seem like a VAM type — it sounds\r\n> more like *VAM Pro*.\r\n> Please go to *Settings → Update → Manual Update → Pedals → firmware →\r\n> pedals-plusx.sfu*,\r\n> then, after the update, select *VAM motor type* again for testing.
