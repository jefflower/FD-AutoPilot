  "description_text": "Good Morning,\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a new pedal box for the pro x ultra, as my last one\r\nstopped reading the position of the pedals accurately. When the new one\r\narrived I got it installed and it fixed the problem. I purchased the new\r\nbox on August 26th, the box started giving me issues yesterday and it's the\r\nsame problems as the old box. I was wondering if the box falls under\r\nwarranty. I was also wondering if this is a common issue? Order number is\r\nSSN2452. Any help is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n",

Then follow the steps below:    Open the software and go to Settings → Update, then click Check for Updates.    Check if the ProX firmware can be updated to version 2.0.3.    If no automatic update is available, please use Manual Update: Path: Settings → Update → Manual Update Firmware → pedals → firmware → pedals-prox.sfu.    After the update, please test again.    If the issue persists, try reconnecting the USB and power cable, then test again.    If it still doesn’t work, please send me a screenshot of the software interface so I can check further for you.",
