I have attached a picture.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this makes it very difficult for me to assign \r\nbuttons and axes, as this axis is constantly being recognized because it \r\nis permanently sending signals.\r\nAnd since this axis does not physically exist, it must be a \r\nsoftware/firmware or hardware problem with the controller box.\r\n\r\nSoftware: Simsonn Manager 2.1.0\r\nFirmware controllbox: CPU1:v2.0.3 CPU2:v2.0.2\r\n\r\nI am curious to know whether you are already aware of this.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nAndreas Kienle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated with DeepL.com (free version)\r\n\r\n",

In the software, click Revert and then Save, and check whether the RX axis is disabled.  If the issue is still not resolved, try a manual firmware update: Go to Settings → Update → Manual Firmware Update → pedals-firmware → pedals-prox.sfu.  After completing the update, please test again.    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mS9dS2GyzhRYo81BcmTIOXY1POa6RvST/view?usp=drive_link",
