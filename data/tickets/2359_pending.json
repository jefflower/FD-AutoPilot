After examining the load cell spring and its support more\r\nclosely, it was found that they were broken. I've attached images of this\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nI'd like to initiate a return and request a full refund for the entire\r\norder. I do not wish to get a replacement.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information from me.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCorey Supel\r\n\r\n",
