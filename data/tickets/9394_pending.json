I received the pedals yesterday, but the tracker is showing that\r\nthe haptic reactors are still in transit. When I put the tracking number\r\nin, the shipper's website shows that the package with the reactors haven't\r\nbeen shipped yet. I just wanted to check in and confirm if they haven't\r\nshipped yet or if there's an issue somewhere?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEthan\r\n\r\n",
