  "description_text": "Dear Simsonn,\r\n\r\nAbout 4 (work) days ago I bought \"Simsonn Plus X Racing Simulation Pedal\r\nwith Haptic Reactor Optional\" with express shipping in the hopes it would\r\narrive early this week. But there seems to be a bit of a problem and that\r\nis that I still haven't received a message/email about that my order has\r\nbeen shipped. After doing some research on your website it is also stated\r\nthat there is a 1–2 days wait before they ship. Now the 1–2 days already\r\npassed and I haven't got an update on where my pedals are.\r\n\r\nIs there any way u can predict when the pedals will arrive at my\r\ndestination/or being shipped and would this be possible to have\r\nbefore Saturday?\r\n\r\nGreets Finn Aders\r\n(order number: #SSN3133)\r\n\r\n",
