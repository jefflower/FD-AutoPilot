  "description_text": "I recently received the upgrade kit for my brake pedal as I bought one of\r\nthe earlier versions of your pedals, the new hydraulic fits in but I’m\r\nhaving a problem with the brake shaft it self. I can fit all 3 of the\r\nelastomers in, I tried to troubleshoot and realized that the joint\r\nconnecting to the pedal arm is different from the newer pedals and also see\r\nthat there is an included updated one in the pack. I cannot seam to figure\r\nout how to take the joint off to put on the new joint.\r\n\r\n",
